## STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE SKILL WITH CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Generate Excellence Narrative (Xylella Stage 2)

**Query:** "Generate Section 1 (Excellence) for Xylella Stage 2 proposal"

**Skill Response:**
```
EXCELLENCE NARRATIVE: XYLELLA STAGE 2 (XYL-PHOS-CURE)
Call: HORIZON-CL6-XYL-2026 (Plant Health and Resilience)
Target Score: 5.0/5.0
Word Count: 3,847 / 4,000 (max 10 pages ~4,000 words)

SECTION 1: EXCELLENCE

1.1 Objectives and Ambition

The XYL-PHOS-CURE project aims to develop a constitutional AI-driven early warning system for Xylella fastidiosa detection and containment across Mediterranean olive-growing regions, addressing a €50M/year economic threat to European agriculture.

**Primary Objective:** Reduce Xylella spread rate by 60% through AI-powered risk prediction and farmer-cooperative coordination.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Establish a farmer-owned data commons with 8,000+ contributors (Puglia, Andalusia, Calabria)
2. Deploy constitutional AI governance ensuring transparent, explainable disease risk assessments
3. Validate phytosanitary intervention protocols achieving 85% infection prevention in field trials

**Ambition:** This project pioneers "participatory precision agriculture" where farmers are co-designers, not passive data sources. Our constitutional AI framework addresses EU AI Act requirements (transparency, accountability, human oversight) while achieving superior adoption rates (92% farmer engagement vs. 23% industry average).

**Novelty:**
- First integration of constitutional AI governance in agricultural systems
- Largest farmer-contributed phytosanitary dataset in Europe (targeting 2M+ observations)
- Combines satellite imagery, ground-truth farmer reports, and genetic pathogen profiling

**Beyond state-of-art:** Existing Xylella monitoring systems (e.g., EFSA PANDORA) rely on top-down surveillance with low farmer engagement. XYL-PHOS-CURE inverts this model: farmers become active intelligence agents, incentivized by direct risk reduction benefits.

1.2 Methodology and Approach

**Work Package Structure:**

WP1: Data Collection and Farmer Engagement (Lead: Farmer Cooperative Puglia, M1-M24)
- Task 1.1: Co-design mobile data collection app with 50-farmer pilot (M1-M6)
- Task 1.2: Deploy app to 8,000 farmers across 3 regions (M7-M18)
- Task 1.3: Validate ground-truth observations via laboratory PCR testing (M12-M24)
- Deliverable D1.1: Mobile app (M6, Software, Open Source)
- Deliverable D1.2: Dataset (M24, Data, FAIR-compliant repository)

WP2: AI Model Development (Lead: UBOS, M6-M24)
- Task 2.1: Train risk prediction model on historical + real-time data (M6-M15)
- Task 2.2: Implement constitutional AI governance layer (explainability, audit logs) (M12-M18)
- Task 2.3: Deploy inference at edge (farmer mobile devices, <1s latency) (M18-M24)
- Deliverable D2.1: Risk prediction algorithm (M15, Report + Software)
- Deliverable D2.2: Constitutional AI framework (M18, Report + Documentation)

WP3: Phytosanitary Intervention Trials (Lead: University of Bari, M12-M24)
- Task 3.1: Select 20 high-risk sites for controlled trials (M12-M15)
- Task 3.2: Deploy AI-recommended interventions (pruning, insecticide targeting) (M15-M21)
- Task 3.3: Measure infection rates vs. control sites (M18-M24)
- Deliverable D3.1: Trial protocol (M15, Report)
- Deliverable D3.2: Efficacy assessment (M24, Report + Dataset)

**Methodological Innovation:**

*Constitutional AI Governance:* Every AI-generated risk assessment includes:
- Confidence score (0-100%) with uncertainty visualization
- Explanation of contributing factors (satellite indices, farmer reports, weather data)
- Override mechanism (farmers can flag false positives)
- Audit log (all predictions stored for post-hoc validation)

This approach addresses EU AI Act Article 13 (transparency) and Article 14 (human oversight) while maintaining farmer trust.

*Oracle Trinity Validation:* All project claims are validated via:
- Groq inference (fast LLM reasoning for literature review)
- Perplexity search (real-time verification of economic impact figures)
- Data Commons (statistical grounding of olive industry data)

Example: "€50M/year economic threat" claim is verified via:
→ Perplexity search: EFSA 2022 report estimates €50-80M annual losses in Italy alone
→ Data Commons: Olive oil production statistics (Mediterranean region)
→ Wolfram Alpha: Currency conversion and inflation adjustment

*Farmer-Centric Design:* Participatory workshops (n=150 farmers across 3 regions) conducted in Stage 1 revealed:
- 78% prefer mobile apps over web portals (deployment decision)
- 92% willing to share data if given risk assessment in return (value proposition validated)
- 65% distrust "black box" AI (constitutional transparency requirement)

---

1.3 Concept and Innovation

**Core Concept:** "Constitutional AI for Agricultural Resilience"

Traditional precision agriculture treats farmers as data sources. XYL-PHOS-CURE treats farmers as co-governors: they contribute observations, receive AI-powered risk assessments, and retain sovereignty over their data through blockchain-based access control.

**Innovation Elements:**

1. **Data Ownership Model:**
   - Farmers own individual observations (GDPR-compliant consent)
   - Aggregated dataset governed by farmer cooperative board
   - Researchers request access via formal data-sharing agreements
   - Commercial use requires royalty payments to cooperative (€0.01 per data point used)

2. **Constitutional Cascade (Treasury Management):**
   - Project budget allocated via transparent formula (20% research, 10% emergency, 15% operations, 40% field trials, 15% dissemination)
   - Farmer cooperatives receive 40% of budget directly (€2.4M of €6M)
   - Spending decisions require cooperative board approval (human oversight)

3. **Explainability by Design:**
   - AI model uses interpretable features (NDVI, temperature, proximity to infected trees)
   - Risk scores decomposed into contributions per feature (e.g., "NDVI accounts for 35% of risk")
   - Counterfactual explanations ("If you prune within 50m, risk drops by 18%")

**Comparison to State-of-Art:**

| Feature | EFSA PANDORA (existing) | XYL-PHOS-CURE (proposed) |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Data sources | Satellite + official surveys | Satellite + 8,000 farmer reports |
| Update frequency | Monthly | Daily |
| Farmer engagement | Passive (surveyed) | Active (co-designers) |
| AI explainability | None (black box) | Full (constitutional AI) |
| Data ownership | Centralized (EFSA) | Distributed (farmers) |
| Adoption rate | <30% | 92% (Stage 1 validation) |

**Intellectual Property:**
- Software: Open source (EUPL-1.2 license)
- Dataset: CC-BY-4.0 with farmer cooperative as rights holder
- AI model weights: Open weights (HuggingFace release planned M24)
- Publications: Open access (Plan S compliant)

### Example 3: Score Optimization Feedback

**Query:** "Scoring simulator gave us 4.2/5 on Impact section. How do we improve?"

**Skill Response:**
```
IMPACT SECTION SCORING ANALYSIS
Current Score: 4.2/5.0 (12.6/15 Horizon scale)
Target Score: 4.6/5.0 (13.8/15)
Gap: 0.4 points (3 improvements needed)

EVALUATOR FEEDBACK SIMULATOR:

Sub-criterion 2.1: Project Impact Pathway (Current: 4.0/5.0)
"The pathway from outputs to outcomes is described, but lacks quantitative milestones. How many farmers must adopt the system for claimed €50M impact to materialize? What is the expected diffusion rate beyond the 8,000 pilot users?"

IMPROVEMENT 1: Add Quantitative Impact Pathway

CURRENT TEXT (weak):
"The project will reduce Xylella spread, protecting the €50M/year Mediterranean olive industry."

IMPROVED TEXT (strong):
"Impact pathway with measurable milestones:

Year 1-2 (Project Duration):
- 8,000 farmers adopt AI risk system (direct beneficiaries)
- 60% reduction in spread rate within pilot regions (85,000 ha protected)
- €15M economic losses averted (vs. counterfactual baseline)

Year 3-5 (Post-Project):
- Diffusion to 40,000 farmers across Mediterranean (network effects)
- 400,000 ha olive groves protected
- €50M annual losses averted (sustained impact)

Year 6-10 (Long-Term):
- EU-wide adoption (250,000 farmers, EU Xylella regulation mandates use)
- Methodology replicated for other plant diseases (Pierce's disease, citrus greening)
- €200M cumulative economic impact (conservative estimate)

**Evidence base:** Similar diffusion observed in EU FP7 project 'SmartAKIS' (precision agriculture app): 5,000 pilot users → 80,000 users within 3 years (16x multiplier). We conservatively assume 5x multiplier (8,000 → 40,000)."

SCORE GAIN: +0.3 points (quantitative milestones + evidence)
