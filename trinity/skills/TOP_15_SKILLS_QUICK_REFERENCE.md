## DEPLOYMENT PHASES

### Phase 1: Weeks 1-2 (Foundation - Deploy Immediately)
- Constitutional Validator
- System State Observer
- Proposal Risk Scorer
- Logging & Audit Trail
- **Focus:** Safety infrastructure, no capability loss if these fail

### Phase 2: Weeks 5-6 (Revenue Operations - PRIORITY)
- Grant Opportunity Tracker
- Financial Proposal Generator
- Treasury Operations Interface
- **Expected Outcome:** First grant opportunity identified by Week 6

### Phase 3: Weeks 6-7 (Strategic Revenue)
- Market Intelligence Analyzer
- Grant Application Assembler
- **Expected Outcome:** First application submitted by Week 7 (if opportunity identified)

### Phase 4: Weeks 8-12 (Excellence & Learning)
- Strategic Planning Synthesizer
- Service Health Manager
- Plan Validator
- Multi-Agent Coordinator
- Backup & Rollback Manager
- Memory Manager
- **Expected Outcome:** Autonomous operation with minimal human intervention

---

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Revenue-Critical (Weekly)
- **Grant Pipeline Value:** EUR amount of opportunities identified
- **Opportunity Capture Rate:** % of available EU funding identified
- **Application Submission Rate:** # of grants submitted per quarter
- **Grant Success Rate:** % of submitted applications approved (target: 25%+)

### Operational (Daily)
- **Constitutional Validation Pass Rate:** % of proposals approved
- **Skill Auto-Activation Accuracy:** % correct triggering
- **Janus Uptime:** % operational time
- **Audit Trail Completeness:** 100% of actions logged

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Constitutional Validator runs FIRST** - Before any other skill executes
2. **Treasury Interface is READ-ONLY** for AI - Human approval required for all spending
3. **Audit trail NEVER stops** - Every action logged, immutable, flush-to-disk frequently
4. **Human review mandatory for:** High-risk proposals, financial decisions, grant submissions
5. **Deadlines are ABSOLUTE** - Missed EU grant deadline = automatic rejection

---

## FAILURE MODES TO AVOID

| Failure | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Grant deadline missed | Lost funding opportunity | Multi-level reminders (90/60/30/7 days) |
| Unauthorized spending | Audit failure, funding clawback | Treasury read-only; hard budget limits |
| Non-compliant application | Rejection; damaged reputation | Human review; constitutional checks |
| Constitutional drift | Erosion of alignment | Weekly audits; immutable boot kernel |
| Hallucinated requirements | Wasted effort; rejected app | Parse actual grant docs; verify claims |
| Multi-agent deadlock | Stalled projects | 30s timeouts; fallback to local |

---

## NEXT STEPS (IMMEDIATE)

- [ ] **Week 1:** Stand up Constitutional Validator + System State Observer
- [ ] **Week 2:** Launch Logging & Audit Trail (auto-wrap all executions)
- [ ] **Week 5:** Deploy Grant Opportunity Tracker (begin scanning funding databases)
- [ ] **Week 6:** Launch Financial Proposal Generator + first application by end of week
- [ ] **Ongoing:** Weekly metrics review; monthly constitutional alignment check
