## 🎯 Overview

The Master Librarian Agent serves as the constitutional knowledge management system for UBOS, providing comprehensive access to UBOS principles, concepts, and constitutional guidance through advanced Gemini 2.5 Pro integration.

## 🚀 Current Status (December 2024)

- **UBOS Knowledge Base:** 10 core constitutional concepts loaded
- **Gemini Integration:** 2.5 Pro model with constitutional consultation
- **Knowledge Graph:** NetworkX-based concept relationships
- **Consultation Output:** 8,000+ character constitutional guidance
- **Response Time:** <15 seconds for complex consultations
- **Success Rate:** 100% operational

## 📖 UBOS Knowledge Concepts

### **Core Constitutional Principles:**
1. **Blueprint Thinking** - Comprehensive planning methodology
2. **Strategic Pause** - Complexity analysis and decision checkpoints
3. **Systems Over Willpower** - Systematic approach to sustainable performance
4. **Constitutional AI** - UBOS alignment embedding throughout systems

### **Implementation Concepts:**
5. **Agent Orchestration** - Multi-agent coordination with constitutional oversight
6. **Knowledge Management** - Structured information handling with constitutional validation
7. **Decision Engine** - Routing decisions with constitutional priority override
8. **Template-Based Architecture** - Reusable components with constitutional compliance

### **Technology Integration:**
9. **Multi-API Coordination** - Perplexity + Gemini integration patterns
10. **Archive Systems** - Constitutional compliance tracking and storage

## 🧠 Knowledge Graph Structure

```python
SimpleKnowledgeGraph:
├── Concepts: 10 UBOS constitutional concepts
├── Relationships: Interconnected concept dependencies
├── Metadata: Constitutional compliance attributes
└── NetworkX Integration: Graph-based relationship mapping
```

### **Concept Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class UBOSConcept:
    id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    constitutional_principles: List[str]
    implementation_guidance: str
    related_concepts: List[str]
    compliance_requirements: Dict[str, Any]
```

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### **Basic Knowledge Access:**
```python
from UBOS.Agents.KnowledgeAgent.MasterLibrarianAgent.load_ubos_knowledge import SimpleKnowledgeGraph

# Initialize knowledge graph
kg = SimpleKnowledgeGraph()

# Access UBOS concepts
concepts = kg.get_concepts()
print(f"Total UBOS concepts: {len(concepts)}")

# Get specific concept
blueprint_concept = kg.get_concept("blueprint_thinking")
print(f"Blueprint Thinking: {blueprint_concept.description}")
```

### **Gemini Constitutional Consultation:**
```python
from UBOS.Agents.KnowledgeAgent.MasterLibrarianAgent.master_librarian.llm.gemini import GeminiClient

# Initialize Gemini client
gemini = GeminiClient()

# Constitutional consultation
consultation = gemini.constitutional_consultation(
    "How should multi-agent systems implement UBOS constitutional principles?",
    {"domain": "enterprise_ai", "complexity": "high"}
)

print(f"Constitutional guidance: {consultation.analysis}")
print(f"Response length: {len(consultation.analysis)} characters")
```

### **Integrated Knowledge Consultation:**
```python
# Combine knowledge graph with Gemini consultation
question = "What are the implementation requirements for Blueprint Thinking?"

# Get relevant concepts
blueprint_concept = kg.get_concept("blueprint_thinking")
context = {
    "concept": blueprint_concept.name,
    "description": blueprint_concept.description,
    "principles": blueprint_concept.constitutional_principles
}

# Get constitutional guidance
guidance = gemini.constitutional_consultation(question, context)
print(f"Implementation guidance: {guidance.analysis}")
```

## 🏛️ Constitutional Integration

### **Knowledge Validation Framework:**
- **Constitutional Compliance:** Every concept validated against UBOS principles
- **Principle Alignment:** Clear mapping to Blueprint Thinking, Strategic Pause, Systems Over Willpower
- **Implementation Guidance:** Practical application of constitutional concepts
- **Relationship Mapping:** Constitutional dependencies between concepts

### **Gemini 2.5 Pro Constitutional Consultation:**
```python
def constitutional_consultation(self, question: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> GeminiResponse:
    prompt = f"""
    Constitutional AI Consultation:
    Question: {question}
    Context: {context}

    Analyze this from UBOS constitutional principles:
    1. Blueprint Thinking: How does this align with comprehensive planning?
    2. Strategic Pause: What complexity considerations are needed?
    3. Systems Over Willpower: What systematic approaches apply?
    4. Constitutional AI: How to embed UBOS principles?

    Provide detailed constitutional guidance with implementation recommendations.
    """
    return self.generate_consultation(prompt)
```
