# Project Charter: 01 - EUFM Refactor & Monetize

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Status:** In Planning

## 1. Strategic Mandate

The primary objective of this project is to refactor and stabilize the core EUFM system, upgrading its architecture with the latest research findings, before proceeding with a feature-by-feature monetization strategy. This project serves as the foundation for the UBOS_2.0 ecosystem.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Stability First:** The EUFM engine must be made robust, reliable, and "work like a clock" before building new systems upon it.
- **Research-Driven:** All technical decisions will be informed by the latest research conducted by our AI agents, particularly the findings in the `enhanced-research-synthesis-report.md`.
- **Specification-Led:** Development will be strictly plan-driven. All major work will be defined in a `spec.md` file before implementation begins.
- **Structured Project Management:** This directory will serve as our single source of truth for plans, specifications, tasks, and decisions.

## 3. High-Level Plan

### Phase 1: Foundational Analysis & Planning (Current Phase)

1.  **Establish Project Management Structure:** Create the `PROJECTS/01_EUFM_REFACTOR_AND_MONETIZE` directory and its initial file structure. (COMPLETED)
2.  **Analyze New Research:** Synthesize the latest findings from the research agents to guide all subsequent planning. (COMPLETED)
3.  **Deep Analysis of EUFM:** Conduct a thorough technical audit of the existing EUFM codebase to identify core functionality, technical debt, and optimization opportunities.
4.  **Create Core Specifications:**
    - `01_EUFM_Core_Refactor.spec.md`: Detail the plan to fix technical debt and stabilize the system.
    - `02_Agent_Coordination_Upgrade.spec.md`: Detail the migration from the current agent logic to the `openai-agents-python` SDK.
    - `03_Codex_Agent_Update.spec.md`: Specify the required changes for the Codex agent.
5.  **Present Unified Strategy:** Consolidate all findings into a single, actionable strategy for approval.

### Phase 2: Core System Refactor & Upgrade

1.  **Implement EUFM Core Refactor:** Execute the plan to stabilize the EUFM codebase.
2.  **Implement Agent Coordination Upgrade:** Replace the deprecated multi-agent framework with the `openai-agents-python` SDK and integrate the Constitutional Governance model.
3.  **Update Codex Agent:** Apply the planned changes to the Codex agent.

### Phase 3: Monetization Implementation

1.  **Re-evaluate Monetization Strategy:** Re-assess the initial monetization plans in the context of the new, powerful Constitutional AI platform.
2.  **Develop Monetization Feature Specs:** Create detailed specifications for the first revenue-generating feature.
3.  **Implement & Deploy:** Begin the step-by-step implementation of monetization features.
