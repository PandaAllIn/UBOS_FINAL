Here are the priority tasks for you to tackle using our available tools:\n\n🎯 PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED:\n1. Fix tri-party chat spam issue (intelligent filtering/rate limiting)\n2. Implement CI tests for system reliability  \n3. Complete orchestrator loop for full automation\n4. Improve chat UI user experience\n5. Add structured logging for better observability\n\n🛠️ TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL:\n- Codex CLI: npm run dev -- codex:exec 'task description'\n- Gemini CLI: npm run dev -- gemini:cli (interactive mode)\n- Direct system access via Claude interface\n- All EUFM agents and capabilities\n\n📋 SUGGESTED APPROACH:\n1. Start with the tri-party chat spam fix (highest priority)\n2. Use Codex CLI to implement intelligent response filtering\n3. Add CI test framework using standard Node.js testing\n4. Enhance orchestrator with better error handling\n5. Improve logging throughout the system\n\nThe full analysis is saved at: /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/logs/gemini_system_analysis_1757349560687.md\n\nReady to coordinate on these improvements?

They can coordinate the work while I handle the technical implementation.\n\nReady to see some powerful AI collaboration in action! 🚀"}

Here's the exact task:\n\n🎯 TASK: Fix tri-party chat spam and make it production-ready\n\n🔧 USE THESE TOOLS:\n1. First analyze with Codex CLI:\n   npm run dev -- codex:exec 'Analyze the tri-party chat spam issue in src/tools/triChat.ts. The problem is duplicate responses from concurrent bridge processes and poor Claude invocation.'\n\n2. Then implement fixes with Codex:\n   npm run dev -- codex:exec 'Fix triChat.ts: 1) Use spawn with prompt as argv not stdin 2) Add file-based locking in locks/ dir 3) Add runBridgeWatch function 4) Graceful error handling'\n\n3. Update CLI with Codex:\n   npm run dev -- codex:exec 'Update src/cli/index.ts tri:watch command to use runBridgeWatch'\n\n4. Test the fixes:\n   npm run dev -- tri:send human claude 'Test message'\n   npm run dev -- tri:bridge 20\n\nSorry for jumping ahead - you should lead this implementation using our tools! Ready to coordinate?"}

Use Codex CLI to create technical implementation plan:\n   npm run dev -- codex:exec 'Create detailed technical architecture for Enterprise AI Orchestration Platform. Review the spec at /monetization-projects/orchestration-saas/specs/001-enterprise-orchestration-platform/spec.md and create: 1) System architecture diagram 2) Database schema 3) API specifications 4) Implementation roadmap 5) Deployment strategy. Focus on multi-tenant SaaS, real-time monitoring, and enterprise security.'\n\n2.

Create actionable tickets for: API gateway, multi-provider adapters, workflow engine, billing system, monitoring dashboard, and enterprise security features.'\n\n3.
