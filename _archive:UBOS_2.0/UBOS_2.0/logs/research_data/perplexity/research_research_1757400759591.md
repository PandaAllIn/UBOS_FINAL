### Enterprise Adoption Rates & Use Cases

- **Adoption Trends**:
  - Rapid **enterprise adoption** across BFSI, professional services, healthcare, and manufacturing[3].
  - **Agentic AI** is moving from pilot projects to production-scale deployments, especially in customer support, document processing, and research automation[1][3].
  - **RPA limitations** are driving organizations to adopt agentic AI for more complex, cognitive tasks—RPA automates only 20-30% of tasks, while agentic AI targets the remainder[5].

- **Case Example: AgentFlow in Finance**
  - Used for **loan and insurance underwriting**, automating document extraction, risk scoring, and compliance checks.
  - **Hybrid orchestration** (centralized + decentralized) enables both strict auditability and flexible agent collaboration[4].

- **Case Example: Microsoft Copilot Studio**
  - Deployed in large enterprises for **workflow automation** across Microsoft 365 apps.
  - Integrates with custom LLMs and external APIs for tailored business logic[1].
