The country ranks 27th among EU27 for several innovation indicators, including SME collaboration and public-private co-publications[1].\n- **Funding intensity per researcher** in Romania (2022–2024) is €4,846.3, below the EU average of €6,194, highlighting a need for increased support and consultancy for Romanian applicants[1].\n- **Upcoming calls:** Several major calls relevant to Romanian SMEs are scheduled for late 2025, including the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership (SBEP) and Eurostars, both co-funded under Horizon Europe[2][4].\n- **Information sessions and support:** Dedicated info sessions and contact points are available for Romanian SMEs, such as the EIT Urban Mobility Regional Innovation Scheme and national contact points for Horizon Europe[3][5].\n\n---\n\n### Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **SMEs introducing product innovations** in Romania increased by +12.3 percentage points between 2018 and 2025[1].\n- **Business process innovation** among SMEs remains stagnant, with Romania ranking 27th in the EU for this indicator[1].\n- **Collaboration among innovative SMEs** declined by 7 percentage points from 2018 to 2025[1].\n- **PCT patent applications** from Romania dropped by 7.3 percentage points, while trademark and design applications grew by 20.3% and 6.3%, respectively[1].\n- **Public-private co-publications** grew by 14.1% but still rank 27th in the EU[1].\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Examples and Case Studies\n\n- **Eurostars Program:** Romanian SMEs have participated in Eurostars, a program supporting international collaborative R&D projects. Eurostars is specifically designed for innovative SMEs and is co-funded by Horizon Europe[4].\n- **Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership (SBEP):** Romanian SMEs are encouraged to join consortia for the SBEP call launching in September 2025, with a focus on stakeholder engagement and innovation impact[2].\n- **EIT Urban Mobility Regional Innovation Scheme:** In 2025, the joint innovation program with ADR Vest in Romania provides targeted support for mobility-related SMEs, including info sessions and direct consultancy access[3].\n\n---\n\n### Key Players and Consultant Landscape\n\n- **National Contact Points (NCPs):** The Romanian government and affiliated agencies (e.g., UEFISCDI) act as NCPs, providing guidance and consultancy for Horizon Europe and Innovation Fund applications[2][5].\n- **Private consultancy firms:** Numerous Romanian and pan-European consultancies specialize in EU funding applications, offering services such as project scoping, proposal writing, and consortium building.\n- **EIT Urban Mobility RIS Team:** Provides direct support for applicants to the Regional Innovation Scheme, including Q&A and proposal guidance[3].\n- **SBEP Partner Search Tool:** Facilitates matchmaking between Romanian SMEs and potential project partners or consultants for the SBEP call[2].\n\n---\n\n### Practical Implications and Applications\n\n- **Immediate project needs:** Romanian SMEs seeking to apply for Horizon Europe or Innovation Fund 2025 calls should:\n  - Engage with NCPs and attend info sessions to understand eligibility, evaluation criteria, and best practices[3][5].\n  - Use partner search tools and networks (e.g., SBEP, Eurostars) to find suitable consortia and consultants[2][4].\n  - Focus on strengthening innovation capacity, collaboration, and intellectual property management to improve competitiveness[1].\n- **Consultant selection:** SMEs should prioritize consultants with proven track records in Horizon Europe and Innovation Fund applications, familiarity with Romanian innovation challenges, and established networks in relevant sectors.\n\n---\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n- **Monitor upcoming calls:** Key deadlines for 2025 include the SBEP pre-proposal deadline (17 November 2025) and Eurostars September 2025 call[2][4].\n- **Leverage support structures:** Utilize info sessions, RIS teams, and national contact points for tailored guidance and troubleshooting[3][5].\n- **Strengthen project proposals:** Emphasize innovation, cross-sector collaboration, and societal impact to align with Horizon Europe priorities[1][5].\n- **Track performance metrics:** Benchmark against EU averages for funding intensity, innovation output, and collaboration to identify areas for improvement[1].\n\n---\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Romanian SMEs are increasingly active in EU innovation programs but face challenges in collaboration and funding intensity.\n- Multiple high-value funding opportunities are open or upcoming in 2025, with strong support structures for applicants.\n- Effective use of consultants and support networks is critical for successful Horizon Europe and Innovation Fund applications.\n\n**Sources:**  \n[1] European Innovation Scoreboard 2025 – Romania  \n[2] Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership (SBEP) Call  \n[3] EIT Urban Mobility Regional Innovation Scheme  \n[4] Eurostars September 2025 Call  \n[5] Horizon Europe Programme Overview (Romania)",
