  "response": "**EU Funding Opportunities for Geothermal Energy Projects in Romania (2025)**\n\n---\n\n### Current Status and Recent Developments\n\n- **EUR 56 Million Geothermal Funding Scheme (2025):**\n  - Romania’s Ministry of Investments and European Projects launched a **EUR 56 million state aid scheme** to support geothermal heating and cooling projects, open for applications until the end of 2025[1][2][4].\n  - The scheme is part of Romania’s **National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)** and is backed by European funds[1][2].\n  - The program specifically targets **local authorities** for the development of geothermal energy infrastructure[1][2][4].\n  - The **Oradea geothermal plant** is cited as a successful example, now supplying 15% of the city’s heat[1][2][5].\n\n- **EUR 300 Million Modernisation Fund Proposal:**\n  - Romania is preparing a **EUR 300 million subsidy package** for geothermal district heating/cooling systems, sourced from the EU’s Modernisation Fund[3].\n  - The scheme is designed to support mature projects through 2030, with an estimated **EUR 33.3 million per project** for nine projects[3].\n  - The fund targets **thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units**[3].\n\n---\n\n### Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **EUR 56 million** available for geothermal heating/cooling projects (2025 call)[1][2][4].\n- **EUR 8 million** maximum grant per project (100% non-refundable)[1][4][5].\n- **Application deadline:** End of 2025 for the current call[1][4].\n- **EUR 300 million** proposed for future subsidies (2025–2030), with **EUR 50 million/year**[3].\n- **Nine projects** expected to be funded under the Modernisation Fund proposal[3].\n- **Emission reduction:** In Beiuș, geothermal energy reduces annual emissions equivalent to removing 11,000 cars from the road[5].\n\n---\n\n### Specific Program Requirements\n\n#### EUR 56 Million Scheme (2025)\n\n- **Eligible Applicants:** Local authorities only[1][2][4].\n- **Eligible Activities:**\n  - Construction, modernization, and expansion of geothermal thermal energy plants[1][2][4].\n  - Infrastructure for transporting thermal energy to public buildings[1][2][4].\n  - Drilling, exploitation, and reinjection equipment for geothermal water[1][2][4].\n  - Heat exchange facilities, machinery, and technical equipment for geothermal energy production[1][2][4].\n- **Funding Details:**\n  - Up to **EUR 8 million** per project[1][4][5].\n  - 100% non-reimbursable grants[1][4].\n- **Application Deadline:** End of 2025[1][4].\n- **Selection:** Open call; no competitive bidding due to sufficient budget for all mature projects[3].\n\n#### Modernisation Fund (Proposed)\n\n- **Eligible Applicants:** Thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units[3].\n- **Eligible Activities:** Production and transport of geothermal heat, modernization of district heating/cooling systems[3].\n- **Funding Details:** Approx. **EUR 33.3 million** per project, no auction required[3].\n- **Timeline:** 2025–2030, with annual allocations[3].\n\n---\n\n### Case Studies and Examples\n\n- **Oradea Geothermal Plant:**\n  - Supplies 15% of city’s heat to hospitals, schools, and public buildings[1][2][5].\n  - Demonstrates replicability and impact of EU-funded geothermal projects in Romania[1][2][5].\n\n- **Beiuș Geothermal Network:**\n  - Emission reductions equivalent to removing 11,000 cars annually[5].\n  - Highlights the challenge of funding caps, as expansion needs exceed current grant limits[5].\n\n---\n\n### Key Players\n\n- **Romanian Ministry of Investments and European Projects (MIPE):** Manages the EUR 56 million scheme[1][2][4].\n- **Romanian Ministry of Energy:** Drafting the Modernisation Fund state aid package[3].\n- **Local Authorities:** Primary beneficiaries and project implementers[1][2][4].\n- **European Union:** Provides funding through NRRP and Modernisation Fund[1][3].\n\n---\n\n### Practical Implications and Applications\n\n- **For Local Authorities:**\n  - Opportunity to modernize district heating, reduce gas dependence, and lower emissions[1][2][5].\n  - Need to prepare mature, technically sound projects to access funding[3].\n  - Projects must focus on public infrastructure (e.g., heating for schools, hospitals)[1][2][4].\n\n- **For Project Developers:**\n  - Collaboration with local authorities is essential, as they are the eligible applicants[1][2][4].\n  - Early engagement with ministries and alignment with NRRP/Modernisation Fund priorities increases success chances[3].\n\n- **For Policy and Energy Transition:**\n  - These schemes support Romania’s decarbonization and energy security goals[1][2][3][5].\n  - Demonstrated benefits in cities like Oradea and Beiuș can serve as models for replication[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\n### Additional Resources and Contacts\n\n- **For further information:** Contact Commercial Service Specialists Maria Petrescu (maria.petrescu@trade.gov) and Mihaela Dodoiu (Mihaela.dodoiu@trade.gov)[4].\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Key Funding Opportunities:**\n\n| Program/Scheme                | Total Budget | Max Grant per Project | Eligible Applicants   | Deadline         | Focus Areas                                   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| NRRP Geothermal Scheme        | EUR 56M      | EUR 8M               | Local authorities    | End of 2025      | Heating/cooling, public infrastructure        |\n| Modernisation Fund (proposed) | EUR 300M     | EUR 33.3M            | Authorities, producers| 2025–2030        | District heating/cooling modernization        |\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] ThinkGeoEnergy  \n[2] Romania Insider  \n[3] Balkan Green Energy News  \n[4] US Department of Commerce/Trade.gov  \n[5] Green European Journal",
