  "response": "A **Horizon Europe proposal template for EUFM (European Union Funding Mechanism) infrastructure funding**—targeting a **consortium** as beneficiary—must align with the latest Horizon Europe requirements, reflect current funding priorities, and demonstrate robust consortium collaboration. Below is a comprehensive guide, including template structure, recent developments, statistics, examples, and actionable insights.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Current Status and Recent Developments\n\n- **Horizon Europe (2021–2027)** is the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme, with a budget of **€93.5 billion** for 2021–2027[3]. The next framework (2028–2034) is proposed at **€175 billion**[3].\n- **Research Infrastructures** are a core focus, with dedicated calls for proposals (e.g., 2025 Work Programme)[1][2].\n- **2025 Calls:** The latest calls for research infrastructure funding opened in June 2025, with deadlines in November 2025[2].\n- **Proposal Evaluation:** Proposals are evaluated by independent experts, with feedback events (e.g., Proposal Check Event 2025) to improve competitiveness[4].\n- **Funding Model:** Lump sum contributions are increasingly used to simplify financial management[1].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **Indicative Budget (2021–2027):** €93.5 billion for Horizon Europe[3].\n- **2025 Infrastructure Call:** 66 proposals submitted for the 2024 call; results expected in 2025[2].\n- **Consortium Requirement:** Proposals typically require **at least three legal entities** from different EU or associated countries[1][3].\n- **Funding Rate:** Up to **100% of eligible costs** for research infrastructure actions[1].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Proposal Template Structure (Consortium, Infrastructure Funding)\n\n**A. Administrative Forms (Part A)**\n- Project title, acronym, duration\n- Consortium composition (partners, roles, countries)\n- Budget breakdown (per partner, cost categories)\n- Ethics and security self-assessment\n\n**B. Technical Description (Part B)**\n1. **Excellence**\n   - Objectives: Clear, measurable, aligned with call topic\n   - Relation to the work programme: Reference specific call and expected outcomes[1]\n   - Concept and methodology: Scientific/technical approach, innovation potential\n   - Consortium expertise: Complementarity, track record\n\n2. **Impact**\n   - Expected outcomes and impacts: Scientific, societal, economic\n   - Contribution to EU policies (e.g., Green Deal, Digital Europe)\n   - Measures to maximize impact: Dissemination, exploitation, communication\n\n3. **Implementation**\n   - Work plan: Work packages, deliverables, milestones\n   - Management structure: Governance, decision-making, risk management\n   - Consortium as a whole: Roles, complementarity, added value of collaboration\n   - Resources: Justification of budget, infrastructure needs\n\n**C. Annexes**\n- Letters of support (if required)\n- Ethics documentation\n- Gender equality plan (for public bodies, higher education, research organizations)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Examples and Case Studies\n\n- **ESS (European Spallation Source):** Large-scale neutron science facility funded under Horizon Europe, involving a multi-country consortium[5].\n- **ELIXIR:** Distributed infrastructure for life science data, demonstrating effective pan-European collaboration and data sharing[5].\n- **SHARE:** Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, showcasing social science infrastructure and long-term impact[5].\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Implications and Applications\n\n- **Consortium Building:** Strong, complementary partnerships across countries and sectors increase competitiveness.\n- **Synergies:** Proposals should highlight synergies with other EU funding (e.g., ERDF, ESI Funds)[1].\n- **Lump Sum Funding:** Simplifies reporting but requires precise planning and justification of costs[1].\n- **Proposal Support:** Use services like the Proposal Check Event for expert feedback before submission[4].\n- **Open Science:** Emphasize data sharing, FAIR principles, and open access to maximize impact.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Actionable Insights\n\n- **Start Early:** Consortium coordination and proposal drafting are time-intensive.\n- **Align with Priorities:** Address specific call topics and expected outcomes in the work programme[1][2].\n- **Demonstrate Impact:** Quantify expected benefits and outline clear exploitation strategies.\n- **Leverage Support:** Engage with National Contact Points (NCPs) and attend info days for guidance[4].\n- **Monitor Developments:** Stay updated on new calls and policy changes via the Funding & Tenders Portal[2][3].\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key Players\n\n- **European Commission (DG RTD, REA):** Programme management and evaluation[3][5].\n- **National Contact Points (NCPs):** Proposal support and guidance[4].\n- **Major Research Infrastructures:** ESS, ELIXIR, SHARE, and others as flagship examples[5].\n\n---\n\n## 8.
