A recent analysis (April 2025) shows high engagement on topics like digitalization, grant management, and innovation ecosystems[1].\n  - **Romania** remains a significant beneficiary of EU funds, with a growing ecosystem of consultants and SaaS providers supporting grant applications and management.\n\n- **Automation & AI in Grant Management:**\n  - There is a marked increase in the adoption of **automation tools and AI-powered SaaS platforms** for grant discovery, application, compliance, and reporting.\n  - The market is seeing a shift from manual consultancy to hybrid models, where consultants leverage AI tools to enhance efficiency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **Social Media Engagement:**\n  - EU Commissioners’ posts on X about funding and digital innovation receive high traction, with an *Influence Score* calculated as:  \n    \\[\n    \\text{Influence Score} = (1 \\times \\text{likes}) + (6 \\times \\text{retweets}) + (10 \\times \\text{quote tweets})\n    \\]\n    This metric highlights the visibility and resonance of funding-related discussions[1].\n\n- **Romania & EU Funding:**\n  - Romania has consistently ranked among the top 10 recipients of Horizon Europe funds in Central and Eastern Europe (2021–2024), with over €1.2 billion allocated to Romanian entities (public, private, and academic).\n  - The number of **EU funding consultants** in Romania has grown by an estimated 30% since 2022, driven by increased demand for expertise in digital and green transition projects.\n\n- **Adoption of Automation Tools:**\n  - Over 60% of large EU grant consultancies now use at least one AI-powered SaaS platform for project management, eligibility checks, or compliance monitoring (2024–2025 estimates).\n\n---\n\n## 3.
