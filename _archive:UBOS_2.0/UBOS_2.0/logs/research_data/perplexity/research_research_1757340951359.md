## Research Results

**DOMAIN:**  
Business, Startups, Venture Capital, Sales, and Marketing—specifically, **presentation design and fundraising**.

**TASK TYPE:**  
*Content creation* (pitch deck generation), *design*, and *automation*.

**COMPLEXITY:**  
**4/10**.  
While creating a pitch deck requires understanding of business narrative and design, the process is now highly automatable with AI tools that generate templates and content based on prompts. Complexity increases if deep customization, data integration, or advanced analytics are needed.

**REQUIREMENTS:**  
- Generate visually appealing, editable pitch deck templates  
- Support for business storytelling structure (problem, solution, market, etc.)  
- Customization (branding, images, charts, etc.)  
- Export to common formats (PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF)  
- Collaboration features  
- Optionally, analytics on deck engagement
