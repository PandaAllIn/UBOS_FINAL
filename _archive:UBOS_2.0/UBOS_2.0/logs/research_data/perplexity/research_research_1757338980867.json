  "response": "**Research Query:** Additional MCP Servers for EUFM Business Development — Integration of GitHub, Slack, Discord, Stripe, Notion, Zapier, Jira, Asana\n\n---\n\n## Current Status and Recent Developments\n\n- **MCP Servers**: The term \"MCP servers\" is ambiguous; in the context of business development and integration, it likely refers to *middleware communication platforms* or *multi-channel platforms* that facilitate integration and automation across business tools.\n- **Integration Ecosystem**: Modern business development increasingly relies on seamless integration between communication (Slack, Discord), code management (GitHub), payment processing (Stripe), knowledge management (Notion), workflow automation (Zapier), and project management (Jira, Asana).\n- **Recent Trends**:\n  - **No-code/low-code automation** (e.g., Zapier) is accelerating cross-platform workflows.\n  - **Open-source bridges** (e.g., Matterbridge, Slackord) are emerging to connect Slack and Discord for unified communication[3][5].\n  - **Native integrations** (e.g., GitHub’s Slack app, Stripe’s Notion widget) are expanding, reducing the need for custom middleware[1][2].\n\n---\n\n## Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **Slack**: Over 32 million daily active users as of 2025, with 2,400+ integrations in its App Directory.\n- **GitHub**: 100+ million developers, with GitHub Actions and Apps as primary integration points.\n- **Discord**: 200+ million monthly active users, increasingly adopted for business and developer communities.\n- **Stripe**: Processes hundreds of billions in payments annually; supports 135+ currencies and payment methods.\n- **Notion**: 30+ million users, with a growing API ecosystem for integrations.\n- **Zapier**: Connects 6,000+ apps, automating over 2 billion tasks per month.\n- **Jira & Asana**: Leading project management tools, each with millions of business users and robust API/integration support.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Examples and Case Studies\n\n### 1. **Slack + GitHub Integration**\n- **Use Case**: Developers receive real-time GitHub notifications (pull requests, issues, deployments) in Slack channels, enabling rapid collaboration and code review.\n- **Implementation**: GitHub Slack App via Slack App Directory; supports slash commands for issue management directly from Slack[1][2].\n- **Impact**: Reduces context switching, accelerates code review cycles, and improves team responsiveness.\n\n### 2. **Slack ↔ Discord Communication Bridge**\n- **Use Case**: Companies with communities on both platforms synchronize messages, ensuring consistent communication.\n- **Tools**:\n  - **Matterbridge**: Open-source bridge supporting Slack, Discord, and other chat platforms.\n  - **Slackord**: Migrates Slack chat history to Discord; used for archiving or platform transitions[5].\n- **Practical Implication**: Maintains unified communication across diverse user bases (e.g., internal teams on Slack, external communities on Discord).\n\n### 3. **Stripe + Notion Integration**\n- **Use Case**: Payment data from Stripe is automatically logged in Notion databases for financial tracking and reporting.\n- **Implementation**: Via Zapier or native Notion widgets.\n- **Impact**: Streamlines financial operations and improves transparency for business development teams.\n\n### 4. **Zapier Workflow Automation**\n- **Use Case**: Automates repetitive tasks, such as creating Jira tickets from GitHub issues or sending Asana tasks to Slack.\n- **Statistics**: Zapier automates billions of tasks monthly, saving teams thousands of hours.\n- **Practical Implication**: Reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and accelerates project delivery.\n\n### 5. **Jira & Asana Project Management**\n- **Use Case**: Integrated with Slack, GitHub, and Zapier for end-to-end project tracking, from code commits to task completion.\n- **Example**: GitHub commits automatically update Jira issues, and Asana tasks trigger Slack notifications.\n\n---\n\n## Key Players and Solutions\n\n| Tool/Platform | Key Role | Integration Highlights | Notable Open-Source Projects |\n|---------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Slack**     | Communication | Native GitHub, Jira, Asana, Zapier apps | Matterbridge, Slackord |\n| **Discord**   | Community/Dev Chat | Bots, webhooks, bridges to Slack | Matterbridge, Slackord |\n| **GitHub**    | Code Management | Slack, Jira, Zapier, Asana integrations | GitHub Actions |\n| **Stripe**    | Payments | Zapier, Notion, Slack notifications | N/A |\n| **Notion**    | Knowledge Mgmt | Zapier, Stripe, Jira, GitHub | Notion API |\n| **Zapier**    | Automation | Connects all above tools | N/A |\n| **Jira/Asana**| Project Mgmt | Slack, GitHub, Zapier | N/A |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications and Applications\n\n- **Business Development**: Integrated toolchains enable faster deal cycles, better customer engagement, and streamlined operations.\n- **Developer Productivity**: Reduces friction between code, communication, and project tracking.\n- **Community Management**: Bridges like Matterbridge unify internal (Slack) and external (Discord) communications.\n- **Financial Operations**: Stripe integrations with Notion and Slack automate revenue tracking and reporting.\n- **Workflow Automation**: Zapier and similar tools reduce manual overhead, allowing teams to focus on high-value tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Insights\n\n- **Adopt open-source bridges** (e.g., Matterbridge) for Slack-Discord integration to maintain communication consistency[3][5].\n- **Leverage Zapier** for automating workflows between GitHub, Jira, Asana, Stripe, and Notion.\n- **Utilize native integrations** where possible to minimize maintenance and security risks.\n- **Monitor emerging tools** in the integration space, as the landscape is rapidly evolving with AI-driven automation and new API capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Sources and References\n\n- AppyPie: Slack-GitHub integration benefits and setup[1].\n- Thena.ai: GitHub-Slack integration guide and best practices[2].\n- GitHub: Open-source Slack-Discord bridges (discord2slack, Slackord)[3][5].\n- GitHub: Slack2Discord for chat history migration[4].\n\nIf you require deeper technical implementation details or specific case studies for EUFM business development, further clarification on \"MCP servers\" or the business context would enable more targeted recommendations.",
