**EU Funding Opportunities for Geothermal Energy Projects in Romania (2025)**

---

### Current Status and Recent Developments

- **EUR 56 Million Geothermal Funding Scheme (2025):**
  - Romania’s Ministry of Investments and European Projects launched a **EUR 56 million state aid scheme** to support geothermal heating and cooling projects, open for applications until the end of 2025[1][2][4].
  - The scheme is part of Romania’s **National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)** and is backed by European funds[1][2].
  - The program specifically targets **local authorities** for the development of geothermal energy infrastructure[1][2][4].
  - The **Oradea geothermal plant** is cited as a successful example, now supplying 15% of the city’s heat[1][2][5].

- **EUR 300 Million Modernisation Fund Proposal:**
  - Romania is preparing a **EUR 300 million subsidy package** for geothermal district heating/cooling systems, sourced from the EU’s Modernisation Fund[3].
  - The scheme is designed to support mature projects through 2030, with an estimated **EUR 33.3 million per project** for nine projects[3].
  - The fund targets **thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units**[3].

### Key Statistics and Data Points

- **EUR 56 million** available for geothermal heating/cooling projects (2025 call)[1][2][4].
- **EUR 8 million** maximum grant per project (100% non-refundable)[1][4][5].
- **Application deadline:** End of 2025 for the current call[1][4].
- **EUR 300 million** proposed for future subsidies (2025–2030), with **EUR 50 million/year**[3].
- **Nine projects** expected to be funded under the Modernisation Fund proposal[3].
- **Emission reduction:** In Beiuș, geothermal energy reduces annual emissions equivalent to removing 11,000 cars from the road[5].

### Specific Program Requirements

#### EUR 56 Million Scheme (2025)

- **Eligible Applicants:** Local authorities only[1][2][4].
- **Eligible Activities:**
  - Construction, modernization, and expansion of geothermal thermal energy plants[1][2][4].
  - Infrastructure for transporting thermal energy to public buildings[1][2][4].
  - Drilling, exploitation, and reinjection equipment for geothermal water[1][2][4].
  - Heat exchange facilities, machinery, and technical equipment for geothermal energy production[1][2][4].
- **Funding Details:**
  - Up to **EUR 8 million** per project[1][4][5].
  - 100% non-reimbursable grants[1][4].
- **Application Deadline:** End of 2025[1][4].
- **Selection:** Open call; no competitive bidding due to sufficient budget for all mature projects[3].

#### Modernisation Fund (Proposed)

- **Eligible Applicants:** Thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units[3].
- **Eligible Activities:** Production and transport of geothermal heat, modernization of district heating/cooling systems[3].
- **Funding Details:** Approx. **EUR 33.3 million** per project, no auction required[3].
- **Timeline:** 2025–2030, with annual allocations[3].

### Case Studies and Examples

- **Oradea Geothermal Plant:**
  - Supplies 15% of city’s heat to hospitals, schools, and public buildings[1][2][5].
  - Demonstrates replicability and impact of EU-funded geothermal projects in Romania[1][2][5].

- **Beiuș Geothermal Network:**
  - Emission reductions equivalent to removing 11,000 cars annually[5].
  - Highlights the challenge of funding caps, as expansion needs exceed current grant limits[5].

---

### Key Players

- **Romanian Ministry of Investments and European Projects (MIPE):** Manages the EUR 56 million scheme[1][2][4].
- **Romanian Ministry of Energy:** Drafting the Modernisation Fund state aid package[3].
- **Local Authorities:** Primary beneficiaries and project implementers[1][2][4].
- **European Union:** Provides funding through NRRP and Modernisation Fund[1][3].

---

### Practical Implications and Applications

- **For Local Authorities:**
  - Opportunity to modernize district heating, reduce gas dependence, and lower emissions[1][2][5].
  - Need to prepare mature, technically sound projects to access funding[3].
  - Projects must focus on public infrastructure (e.g., heating for schools, hospitals)[1][2][4].

- **For Project Developers:**
  - Collaboration with local authorities is essential, as they are the eligible applicants[1][2][4].
  - Early engagement with ministries and alignment with NRRP/Modernisation Fund priorities increases success chances[3].

- **For Policy and Energy Transition:**
  - These schemes support Romania’s decarbonization and energy security goals[1][2][3][5].
  - Demonstrated benefits in cities like Oradea and Beiuș can serve as models for replication[1][2][5].
