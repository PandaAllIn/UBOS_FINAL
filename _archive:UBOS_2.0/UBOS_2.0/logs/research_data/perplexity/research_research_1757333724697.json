  "response": "**EU Funding Opportunities for AI Research Projects in Romania 2025**  \n*Context: European Union funding, grants, and Horizon Europe programs*\n\n---\n\n### Current Status and Recent Developments\n\n- **Romania’s AI Ecosystem Growth**: As of August 2024, Romania had approximately **146 AI product companies** and **49,100 professionals** working in AI, indicating rapid sector expansion[1].\n- **Strategic Alignment**: Romania updated its national AI strategy in 2024 to align with the **EU AI Act**, emphasizing ethical and effective AI deployment[1].\n- **Infrastructure Investments**: The **Technical University of Cluj-Napoca** established Romania’s first dedicated AI research institute, featuring 30 advanced labs focused on healthcare, transportation, and cybersecurity[1].\n- **EU Funding Disbursement**: In June 2025, the European Commission disbursed a **third payment of €1.3 billion** in grants and loans to Romania, supporting digital and innovation projects, including AI[5].\n- **Digital Decade Roadmap**: Romania’s digitalization plan includes **98 measures** with a budget of **€3.6 billion**, a substantial share from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), targeting digital transformation and AI adoption[4].\n\n---\n\n### Key EU Funding Mechanisms for AI Research\n\n- **Horizon Europe (2021–2027)**:\n    - The EU’s flagship research and innovation program, with a budget of **€95.5 billion**.\n    - AI is a core focus, especially under **Pillar II: Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness**, including the “Digital, Industry and Space” cluster.\n    - Calls for proposals in 2025 include topics such as **AI for Science**, **AI-enabled digital transformation**, and **AI for societal challenges**[3].\n    - Example: The “Facilitated cooperation for AI in Science” (HORIZON-CL4-INDUSTRY-2025-01-DIGITAL-62) call supports projects structuring AI-enabled research and developing a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for AI in Science[3].\n\n- **Digital Europe Programme (DEP)**:\n    - Focuses on building digital capacity, including AI, supercomputing, and cybersecurity.\n    - Supports the creation of **European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)**, several of which are active in Romania, helping SMEs and public sector organizations adopt AI[4].\n\n- **National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)**:\n    - Provides funding for digital transformation, including AI research, infrastructure, and skills development.\n    - A significant portion of the €3.6 billion digitalization budget is allocated to AI-related projects[4][5].\n\n---\n\n### Key Statistics and Data Points\n\n- **AI Companies in Romania (2024)**: 146\n- **AI Professionals in Romania (2024)**: 49,100[1]\n- **Total Funding for Top 10 Romanian Startups (H1 2025)**: €80.07 million[2]\n- **Largest AI Funding Round (2025)**: DRUID AI, €42.7 million (Series C)[2]\n- **Romania’s Digitalization Budget (2025)**: €3.6 billion[4]\n- **EU Disbursement to Romania (June 2025)**: €1.3 billion[5]\n\n---\n\n### Relevant Examples and Case Studies\n\n- **DRUID AI**:\n    - Romanian startup specializing in enterprise AI agents.\n    - Raised **€42.7 million** in Series C funding in 2025, with total funding reaching €85.9 million[2].\n    - Supported by both private investors and EU innovation programs.\n\n- **Technical University of Cluj-Napoca AI Institute**:\n    - Established in 2024 with 30 advanced labs.\n    - Focuses on AI research in healthcare, transportation, and cybersecurity.\n    - Attracts EU and national funding for collaborative research[1].\n\n- **Horizon Europe AI for Science Project**:\n    - EU-funded initiative to develop a **Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda** for AI in science.\n    - Mobilizes domain and AI researchers to identify long-term challenges and pilot areas for AI-enabled breakthroughs[3].\n\n---\n\n### Key Players\n\n- **Universities and Research Institutes**: Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, University Politehnica of Bucharest.\n- **Startups and Scaleups**: DRUID AI, FintechOS, Creatopy, Genezio, FilmChain[1][2].\n- **Government Agencies**: Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization.\n- **EU Bodies**: European Commission (DG CONNECT, DG RTD), Horizon Europe program committees.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Implications and Applications\n\n- **For Researchers**:\n    - Multiple open calls under **Horizon Europe** and **Digital Europe** for AI research, especially in science, industry, and public sector digitalization.\n    - Opportunities for cross-border collaboration and access to advanced infrastructure.\n\n- **For Startups and SMEs**:\n    - Access to funding via **EDIHs**, national grants, and EU programs.\n    - Support for scaling AI solutions and integrating into European value chains.\n\n- **For Policymakers**:\n    - Need to address R&D gaps and support SME innovation to fully leverage EU funding[4].\n    -
