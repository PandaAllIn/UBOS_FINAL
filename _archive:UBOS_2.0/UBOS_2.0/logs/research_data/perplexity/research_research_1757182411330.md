- **Sources Preference:** mixed
- **Timeframe:** all

## Research Results

A **Horizon Europe proposal template for EUFM (European Union Funding Mechanism) infrastructure funding**—targeting a **consortium** as beneficiary—must align with the latest Horizon Europe requirements, reflect current funding priorities, and demonstrate robust consortium collaboration. Below is a comprehensive guide, including template structure, recent developments, statistics, examples, and actionable insights.

---

## 1. Current Status and Recent Developments

- **Horizon Europe (2021–2027)** is the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme, with a budget of **€93.5 billion** for 2021–2027[3]. The next framework (2028–2034) is proposed at **€175 billion**[3].
- **Research Infrastructures** are a core focus, with dedicated calls for proposals (e.g., 2025 Work Programme)[1][2].
- **2025 Calls:** The latest calls for research infrastructure funding opened in June 2025, with deadlines in November 2025[2].
- **Proposal Evaluation:** Proposals are evaluated by independent experts, with feedback events (e.g., Proposal Check Event 2025) to improve competitiveness[4].
- **Funding Model:** Lump sum contributions are increasingly used to simplify financial management[1].

---

## 2. Key Statistics and Data Points

- **Indicative Budget (2021–2027):** €93.5 billion for Horizon Europe[3].
- **2025 Infrastructure Call:** 66 proposals submitted for the 2024 call; results expected in 2025[2].
- **Consortium Requirement:** Proposals typically require **at least three legal entities** from different EU or associated countries[1][3].
- **Funding Rate:** Up to **100% of eligible costs** for research infrastructure actions[1].

## 3. Proposal Template Structure (Consortium, Infrastructure Funding)

**A. Administrative Forms (Part A)**
- Project title, acronym, duration
- Consortium composition (partners, roles, countries)
- Budget breakdown (per partner, cost categories)
- Ethics and security self-assessment

**B. Technical Description (Part B)**
1. **Excellence**
   - Objectives: Clear, measurable, aligned with call topic
   - Relation to the work programme: Reference specific call and expected outcomes[1]
   - Concept and methodology: Scientific/technical approach, innovation potential
   - Consortium expertise: Complementarity, track record

2. **Impact**
   - Expected outcomes and impacts: Scientific, societal, economic
   - Contribution to EU policies (e.g., Green Deal, Digital Europe)
   - Measures to maximize impact: Dissemination, exploitation, communication

3. **Implementation**
   - Work plan: Work packages, deliverables, milestones
   - Management structure: Governance, decision-making, risk management
   - Consortium as a whole: Roles, complementarity, added value of collaboration
   - Resources: Justification of budget, infrastructure needs

**C. Annexes**
- Letters of support (if required)
- Ethics documentation
- Gender equality plan (for public bodies, higher education, research organizations)

## 4. Relevant Examples and Case Studies

- **ESS (European Spallation Source):** Large-scale neutron science facility funded under Horizon Europe, involving a multi-country consortium[5].
- **ELIXIR:** Distributed infrastructure for life science data, demonstrating effective pan-European collaboration and data sharing[5].
- **SHARE:** Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, showcasing social science infrastructure and long-term impact[5].

---

## 5. Practical Implications and Applications

- **Consortium Building:** Strong, complementary partnerships across countries and sectors increase competitiveness.
- **Synergies:** Proposals should highlight synergies with other EU funding (e.g., ERDF, ESI Funds)[1].
- **Lump Sum Funding:** Simplifies reporting but requires precise planning and justification of costs[1].
- **Proposal Support:** Use services like the Proposal Check Event for expert feedback before submission[4].
- **Open Science:** Emphasize data sharing, FAIR principles, and open access to maximize impact.

---

## 6. Actionable Insights

- **Start Early:** Consortium coordination and proposal drafting are time-intensive.
- **Align with Priorities:** Address specific call topics and expected outcomes in the work programme[1][2].
- **Demonstrate Impact:** Quantify expected benefits and outline clear exploitation strategies.
- **Leverage Support:** Engage with National Contact Points (NCPs) and attend info days for guidance[4].
- **Monitor Developments:** Stay updated on new calls and policy changes via the Funding & Tenders Portal[2][3].

---

## 7. Key Players

- **European Commission (DG RTD, REA):** Programme management and evaluation[3][5].
- **National Contact Points (NCPs):** Proposal support and guidance[4].
- **Major Research Infrastructures:** ESS, ELIXIR, SHARE, and others as flagship examples[5].
