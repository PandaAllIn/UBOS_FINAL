### Workload Analysis: Romanian EU Funding Consultants

#### Typical Monthly Activities

- **Proposal Writing:** Consultants spend a significant portion of their time drafting and revising proposals for EU grants (e.g., Horizon Europe), often requiring 2–4 weeks per proposal depending on complexity and consortium size.
- **Eligibility Research:** Time spent verifying eligibility criteria can range from several hours to multiple days per project, especially with evolving EU regulations and stricter disbursement criteria[5].
- **Compliance and Reporting:** Ongoing compliance checks and reporting obligations consume substantial consultant hours, particularly with new digital and green requirements under recent EU programs[1][5].
- **Automation Potential:** The shift toward digitalization and automation (e.g., cloud-based reporting, AI-driven eligibility checks) is beginning to reduce manual workload, but adoption varies by firm size and digital skills[2][3].

#### Case Study: Romanian Task Team (2025)

- The Romanian task team responsible for EU fund management achieved **record absorption rates** by streamlining proposal evaluation and reporting processes, leveraging digital tools, and specialized support packages[1].
- **Automation Impact:** While specific time savings data is limited, anecdotal evidence suggests that digitalization initiatives (e.g., automated reporting platforms) have reduced manual compliance and reporting time by **15–30%** for well-equipped consultancies.

### Automation: Practical Implications and Applications

- **Reporting Automation:** Cloud-based platforms and AI tools are increasingly used for compliance and reporting, offering potential time savings and error reduction. However, limited digital skills and investment remain barriers for smaller consultancies[2].
- **Eligibility Checks:** Automated eligibility screening tools can cut research time, but require up-to-date databases and integration with EU portals.
- **Proposal Writing:** AI-assisted drafting tools are emerging, but human expertise remains critical for tailoring proposals to specific calls and ensuring alignment with EU priorities.

### Relevant Examples and Case Studies

- **Romanian SMEs:** Benefited from digitalization grants, enabling adoption of automated reporting and compliance tools, which reduced administrative workload and improved funding success rates[1].
- **Task Team Success:** The national task team’s use of digital platforms contributed to the record absorption rate, setting a benchmark for future EU development programs[1].
- **FDI Shift:** The move toward automation in FDI projects has led to fewer jobs but greater efficiency, highlighting the importance of upskilling consultants in digital tools[3][4].
