## Pricing Models

| Provider   | Pricing Model Highlights                                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenAI** | Subscription (ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise), API usage-based pricing, Azure integration for scale[1][2] |
| **Anthropic** | API access (Claude for Work/Enterprise), usage-based pricing, enterprise contracts with compliance guarantees[1][2] |
| **Google** | Workspace add-ons (Gemini), API pricing, enterprise licensing, no use of customer data for model training[1] |
| **Microsoft** | Microsoft 365 Copilot as add-on, per-user/month pricing, included in enterprise bundles, no data used for training[1] |

- **Cost Pressures**: All providers face high operational costs; even paying users may not cover the full cost of running large models, leading to ongoing losses despite high revenues[5].
