### 1. **Current Status and Recent Developments**

- **EU Funding for Romania (2028–2034):**
  - Romania is set to receive **EUR 60.2 billion** in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), including EUR 54.6 billion for cohesion and agriculture, EUR 4.6 billion for the social climate fund, and EUR 1 billion for migration policies[1].
  - This represents a **17% increase** over the previous period but comes with **stricter disbursement criteria** and a greater emphasis on project quality and compliance[1].

- **EU Funding Landscape (2021–2030):**
  - Romania can access **almost EUR 100 billion** in EU funding between 2021 and 2030, but only about **10% is available for business projects**; the rest targets public investment[3].
  - Key programs: Structural and Cohesion Funds (2021–2027), PNRR (Recovery and Resilience Plan, until 2026), and the Modernization Fund (until 2030)[3].

- **VAT and Fiscal Changes:**

### 2. **Consultancy Commission Rates and Business Models**

#### **A. Typical Commission Structures**

- **Success Fee Model:**
  - Most EU funding consultancies in Romania and Central/Eastern Europe operate on a **success fee basis**, charging a percentage of the grant secured.
  - **Typical commission rates:** **5%–15%** of the grant amount, depending on project complexity, funding program, and consultancy reputation.
  - For highly competitive programs (e.g., Horizon Europe), rates may reach the upper end of this range.

- **Fixed Fee or Hybrid Models:**
  - Some firms offer a **fixed fee** for proposal writing (EUR 2,000–10,000+ per project), with a lower success fee (e.g., 3%–7%) if the application is successful.
  - Hybrid models combine an upfront payment with a reduced success fee, balancing risk for both client and consultant.

- **Project Management Fees:**
  - For ongoing project management (post-award), fees are typically **monthly retainers** (EUR 1,000–5,000/month) or a percentage (1%–5%) of the grant for the duration of the project.

#### **B. Influencing Factors**

- **Project Size and Complexity:** Larger, multi-partner, or innovative projects (e.g., Horizon Europe RIA/IA) command higher fees.
- **Funding Program:** National vs. EU-level programs (e.g., Horizon Europe, LIFE, Interreg) have different administrative burdens and success rates, affecting pricing.
- **Client Profile:** SMEs, universities, and municipalities may negotiate different terms based on their capacity and project pipeline.
