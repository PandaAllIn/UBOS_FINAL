**Successful EU-Funded Geothermal Energy Projects in Romania (2025): Detailed Analysis**

---

### Current Status and Recent Developments

- **EUR 56 Million Geothermal Funding Scheme (2025):**
    - Romania’s Ministry of Investments and European Projects launched a **EUR 56 million state aid scheme** for geothermal heating and cooling projects, open until the end of 2025[1][2][4].
    - The program is part of the **National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)**, aiming to modernize district heating and support EU decarbonization targets[1][2][4].
    - **Eligibility:** Only local authorities can apply[1][2][4].
    - **Maximum Grant:** Up to **EUR 8 million per project**, non-reimbursable[1][4].
    - **Key Focus:** Construction, modernization, and expansion of geothermal plants; infrastructure for heat transport to public buildings; drilling and equipment for geothermal exploitation and reinjection[1][2][4].

- **EUR 300 Million Modernisation Fund Proposal:**
    - Romania is preparing a **EUR 300 million subsidy scheme** for geothermal district heating/cooling, sourced from the EU’s Modernisation Fund[3].
    - **Annual Budget:** EUR 50 million per year through 2030[3].
    - **Beneficiaries:** Thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units[3].
    - **No Competitive Bidding:** The budget is sufficient for all mature projects; nine projects are expected to split the funds (approx. EUR 33.3 million each)[3].

### Key Statistics and Data Points

- **Geothermal Potential:** Romania has substantial geothermal resources, especially in the western and central regions[2][4][5].
- **Utilization:** Most geothermal energy is currently used for district heating and spas; electricity generation remains limited[4].
- **Oradea Case Study:** The city’s geothermal heating plant now covers **15% of the city’s heat supply**, serving hospitals, schools, and public buildings[1][2][5].
- **Beiuș Case Study:** Annual CO₂ emission reductions from geothermal energy are equivalent to removing **11,000 cars** from the road[5].

### Relevant Examples and Case Studies

#### **Oradea Geothermal Heating Plant**
- **Funding:** Supported by EU funds under previous schemes, now cited as a model for replication[1][2][5].
- **Impact:** Supplies heat to public institutions, covers 15% of city demand, and demonstrates successful decarbonization and cost reduction[1][2][5].
- **Replication:** The current EUR 56 million scheme is designed to enable similar projects in other municipalities[1][2].

#### **Beiuș Geothermal Network**
- **Challenge:** Expansion and modernization require more than the maximum EUR 8 million grant available under the current scheme[5].
- **Environmental Impact:** Significant emission reductions, demonstrating the climate benefits of geothermal district heating[5].

---

### Specific Program Requirements

- **Eligible Applicants:** Only **local authorities** (city halls, municipal administrations)[1][2][4].
- **Eligible Activities:**
    - Construction, modernization, expansion of geothermal plants[1][2][4].
    - Infrastructure for transporting thermal energy to public buildings[1][2][4].
    - Drilling, exploitation, reinjection equipment, heat exchangers, and technical machinery[1][2][4].
- **Grant Amount:** Up to **EUR 8 million per project** (EUR 56 million total budget)[1][2][4].
- **Funding Type:** **100% non-refundable grant**[4].
- **Application Deadline:** **End of 2025**[1][2][4].

#### **Modernisation Fund Proposal (EUR 300 Million)**
- **Eligible Entities:** Thermal energy producers, municipal authorities, and their units[3].
- **Funding Calculation:** Covers net additional costs (funding gaps) determined by project scenario analysis[3].
- **No Auction:** All mature projects expected to be funded; nine projects anticipated[3].

### Practical Implications and Applications

- **Decarbonization:** Supports Romania’s transition away from gas and fossil fuels, aligning with EU climate goals[1][2][3][5].
- **Energy Security:** Reduces dependence on imported gas, increases local renewable energy capacity[2][5].
- **Municipal Benefits:** Lower heating bills, improved air quality, and enhanced energy resilience for public buildings[1][2][5].
- **Replication Potential:** Oradea’s success provides a blueprint for other cities; funding mechanisms are designed to scale up similar projects nationwide[1][2][5].

### Key Players

- **Romanian Ministry of Investments and European Projects (MIPE)**
- **Romanian Ministry of Energy**
- **Local Authorities (e.g., Oradea, Beiuș)**
- **EU Modernisation Fund**

---

### Actionable Insights

- **Local authorities** should prepare mature project proposals focused on district heating modernization, leveraging the EUR 56 million scheme before the end-of-2025 deadline[1][2][4].
- **Municipalities** with significant geothermal resources (especially in western and central Romania) are best positioned to benefit[2][4][5].
- **Early engagement** with MIPE and the Ministry of Energy is recommended to ensure eligibility and maximize funding opportunities[4].
- **Projects exceeding EUR 8 million** may seek additional support from the forthcoming EUR 300 million Modernisation Fund[3].

---

**Key Findings:**  
- Romania’s geothermal funding landscape in 2025 is characterized by substantial EU-backed investment, targeted at local authorities for district heating modernization, with clear eligibility criteria and significant climate and economic benefits demonstrated by successful projects in Oradea and Beiuș[1][2][3][4][5].
