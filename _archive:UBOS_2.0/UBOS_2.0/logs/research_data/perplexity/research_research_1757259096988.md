**Current EU Funding Deadlines 2025 for Geothermal Energy & AI Data Center Projects (Horizon Europe, Innovation Fund)**

---

### 1. **Current Status and Recent Developments**

- **Horizon Europe 2025 Calls**: The EU’s main research and innovation program, Horizon Europe, has several relevant calls in 2025 under Cluster 5: Climate, Energy and Mobility, focusing on the green and digital transitions, including geothermal energy and energy-efficient digital infrastructure[1][4][5].
- **Innovation Fund**: While not directly referenced in the search results, the Innovation Fund continues to support large-scale demonstration projects in renewable energy and energy storage, often overlapping with Horizon Europe priorities.
- **Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETPartnership)**: This partnership, funded under Horizon Europe, is running joint calls in 2025 for geothermal energy innovation, with a focus on zero-emission heating/cooling and power generation[2][3].

| **HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-03**                            | Novel approaches to geothermal resources         | 6 May 2025      | 2 Sep 2025, 17:00       | €20M total, ~€10M/project, 70%   |
| **CETPartnership Joint Call 2025**                        | Geothermal energy (heating, cooling, storage)    | 11 Jun 2025     | 9 Oct 2025 (Stage 1)    | €12M indicative budget           |
|                                                           |                                                  | 9 Jan 2026      | 12 Mar 2026 (Stage 2)   |                                  |
| **Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CM2024-07)**       | Geothermal energy technologies                   | 16 Sep 2025     | 17 Feb 2026             | €12M indicative budget           |
| **Other Horizon Europe Cluster 5 Calls**                  | Energy, mobility, digital infrastructure         | Various         | Sep–Oct 2025            | Up to €69M for largest projects  |

- **Application Structure**: Most calls require international consortia, with at least three partners from three different countries (two from EU/HE Associated States)[2][3].
- **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)**: Projects are expected to reach TRL 6-7 (demonstration in relevant environment)[1].

---

### 3. **Key Statistics and Data Points**

- **Funding Rate**: Up to **70%** of eligible costs for research and innovation actions[1].
- **Typical Project Size**: **€10 million** per project for geothermal calls[1].
- **Total Call Budgets**: Range from **€12 million** (CETPartnership) to **€69 million** (largest Cluster 5 calls)[1][2][4].
- **Consortium Requirements**: Minimum three partners from three countries, with at least two from EU/HE Associated States[2][3].

---

### 4. **Relevant Examples and Case Studies**

- **Geothermal Data Centers**: While no specific funded AI data center geothermal projects are listed in the search results, the structure of the calls (notably HORIZON-CL5-2025-02-D3-03) is designed to support innovative geothermal applications, including integration with digital infrastructure and data centers[1][4].
- **Portfolio Balance**: The Horizon Europe geothermal call ensures funding for both shallow/low-mid enthalpy and deep/high enthalpy geothermal projects, supporting a diverse range of applications, potentially including energy supply for AI data centers[1].
- **CETPartnership**: Prior calls have funded projects on underground thermal energy storage and geothermal integration into district heating, which are relevant for energy-intensive digital infrastructure[2][3].

---

### 5. **Practical Implications and Applications**

- **AI Data Centers**: Projects proposing the use of geothermal energy for powering or cooling AI/data centers are eligible under these calls, provided they demonstrate innovation and significant impact on energy efficiency and emissions reduction[1][4].
- **Consortium Building**: Early identification of partners across EU/HE Associated States is critical due to consortium requirements[2][3].
- **Application Preparation**: Proposals must be concise (e.g., 45 pages for Horizon Europe Part B), address call-specific impact criteria, and be submitted via the official portals[1][2][3].
- **Balanced Portfolio**: Applicants should consider whether their project addresses shallow or deep geothermal, as the call aims to fund both categories[1].

---

### 6. **Key Players and Stakeholders**

- **European Commission (DG RTD, DG ENER)**: Oversees Horizon Europe and Innovation Fund calls.
- **CETPartnership**: Coordinates joint calls for energy transition, including geothermal.
- **National Funding Agencies**: Co-fund and manage national/regional aspects of CETPartnership projects.
- **Industry and Research Consortia**: Universities, research institutes, energy companies, and digital infrastructure providers (including data center operators).

---

### 7. **Actionable Insights**

- **Monitor Official Portals**: Regularly check the Horizon Europe Funding & Tenders Portal and CETPartnership site for updates, call documents, and info days[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Engage Early**: Start consortium building and project planning well ahead of deadlines, especially for large-scale or cross-sector projects.
- **Leverage Info Days**: Participate in EU info days and brokerage events to find partners and clarify eligibility or scope questions[4][5].
- **Align with EU Priorities**: Emphasize climate neutrality, digital transition, and innovation in geothermal applications for digital infrastructure in proposals.
