## Research Results

**Codex CLI Troubleshooting: Timeout Issues, MCP Server Integration, and Cursor IDE Compatibility**

---

### 1. Current Status and Recent Developments

- **Timeout Issues:**  
  Recent updates to Codex CLI have changed default script timeout settings, but users report inconsistencies. For example, while documentation states a 10-minute timeout, some users experience scripts being killed after 5 minutes, even on Pro accounts[1].  
  There are also reports of tasks running indefinitely or hanging, with the interface failing to respond to manual stop commands[3].

- **MCP Server Integration Problems:**  
  On Windows, MCP (Multiprocessing Control Protocol) server integration is problematic, especially when environment variables like `SystemRoot` or `windir` are missing. This leads to errors such as `WinError 10106`, preventing MCP child processes from launching[4].  
  Timeout and "bad request" errors have increased since the 0.30 Codex CLI update on Windows[4].

- **Cursor IDE Compatibility and Version Conflicts:**  
  Compatibility issues between Codex CLI and IDEs like Cursor or VS Code are frequently reported. For example, the Codex IDE extension for VS Code fails to save local sessions upon closing[4].  
  Version conflicts, especially after updates, can result in increased timeout and bad request errors[4].

### 2. Key Statistics and Data Points

- **Timeout Settings:**  
  - Official timeout: 10 minutes (per changelog)[1].
  - User-reported actual timeout: 5 minutes (persistent across multiple accounts)[1].
- **Error Reports:**  
  - Multiple open GitHub issues related to timeouts, bad requests, and MCP server failures as of September 2025[4].
- **Platform Recommendations:**  
  - On Windows, WSL2 is recommended over native execution for stability[5].

---

### 3. Causes of Timeout and Integration Issues

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  - Missing or misconfigured environment variables (e.g., `SystemRoot`, `windir`) can prevent MCP servers from launching, especially on Windows[4].
  - Inadequate permissions or missing dependencies in the local environment can cause file access errors and command execution failures[2].

- **Network and Authentication:**  
  - Connectivity problems, such as firewall or proxy restrictions, can block API access, leading to timeouts[2].
  - Invalid or insufficiently privileged API keys can cause authentication errors[2].

- **Version Conflicts:**  
  - Upgrading Codex CLI or related extensions can introduce incompatibilities, especially if dependencies are not updated in tandem[4].

- **Resource Limits:**  
  - Rate limits or resource exhaustion (e.g., exceeding allowed compute time or memory) can cause tasks to hang or fail[3].

---

### 4. Solutions and Troubleshooting Steps

- **Basic Troubleshooting:**  
  - Verify internet connectivity and ensure the OpenAI API key is set and valid[2].
  - Check that all required environment variables are present, especially on Windows (`SystemRoot`, `windir`)[4].
  - Ensure Codex CLI has permissions to access necessary files and directories[2].
  - Use verbose logging (`--verbose` flag) to diagnose where failures occur[2].

- **Addressing Timeout Issues:**  
  - If scripts are killed before the documented timeout, check for local resource constraints or update to the latest CLI version[1][4].
  - Use the `codex --upgrade` command to ensure you have the latest bug fixes[2].
  - For infinite hangs, use `CTRL-C` to cancel operations and restart with different parameters[2].

- **MCP Server Integration:**  
  - On Windows, prefer running Codex CLI under WSL2 for better compatibility[5].
  - Ensure all required system environment variables are set before launching Codex CLI[4].

- **IDE Compatibility and Version Conflicts:**  
  - After updating Codex CLI or IDE extensions, verify that all dependencies are compatible and up to date[4].
  - Report persistent issues on the official GitHub repository, including error messages, OS details, and steps to reproduce[2][4].

### 5. Examples and Case Studies

- **Case: Script Timeout Discrepancy**  
  A user on a Pro account reported that scripts were consistently killed at 5 minutes despite the changelog stating a 10-minute timeout. This suggests either a backend enforcement issue or a local configuration override[1].

- **Case: MCP Server Launch Failure on Windows**  
  Users encountered `WinError 10106` when launching MCP servers due to missing `SystemRoot`/`windir` variables. Setting these variables resolved the issue, highlighting the importance of environment configuration[4].

- **Case: Infinite Task Hang**  
  A user reported a task that ran indefinitely and could not be stopped via the UI, indicating a need for better process management and error handling in the CLI[3].

### 6. Practical Implications and Applications

- **For Teams:**  
  Codex CLI is designed for safe, auditable code automation in team environments, with features like AGENTS.md for shared guidance and configurable guardrails[5].

- **For CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  Headless execution (`codex exec`) is suitable for automated tasks, but timeout and integration issues must be proactively managed[5].

- **For Windows Users:**  
  Running under WSL2 and ensuring proper environment setup is critical for stability[5].

### 7. Key Players and Community Resources

- **OpenAI:**  
  Maintains Codex CLI and provides official documentation and changelogs[1][5].
- **GitHub Community:**  
  Active issue tracking and user support for bug reports and feature requests[4].
- **Cursor and VS Code:**  
  Popular IDEs for Codex CLI integration, with ongoing compatibility updates[4].
