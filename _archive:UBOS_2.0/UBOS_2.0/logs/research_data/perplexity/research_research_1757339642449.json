  "response": "**Figma MCP Server Installation & Cursor IDE Integration: Comprehensive Guide**\n\nThis guide details the installation and configuration of the **Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for use with **Cursor IDE**, covering current practices, technical steps, real-world applications, and recent developments in design-to-code collaboration.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Current Status & Recent Developments**\n\n- **Figma MCP server** enables seamless integration between Figma and AI-powered IDEs like Cursor, automating the conversion of design assets into production-ready code[1][2][5].\n- **Cursor IDE** (v0.47.8 and above) natively supports MCP servers, including Figma, with improved support for remote workspaces (e.g., WSL, SSH)[3][4].\n- The **Figma MCP ecosystem** is expanding, with tools like Windsurf, Cline, and Claude Desktop also adopting similar protocols for design-to-code workflows[5].\n- **AI-assisted design-to-code** is rapidly gaining traction, with Cursor and Figma MCP at the forefront, enabling faster prototyping and reducing manual handoff errors[2][5].\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Installation & Configuration Steps**\n\n### **A. Prerequisites**\n\n- **Figma account** with API access\n- **Node.js** (latest LTS version)\n- **Cursor IDE** (downloadable with a 14-day free trial)[2]\n- (Optional) **Ubuntu WSL** for Windows users for improved compatibility[3]\n\n### **B. Obtain Figma API Token**\n\n1. Log in to Figma.\n2. Go to **Settings > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.\n3. Click **Generate new token**, name it (e.g., \"Cursor MCP\"), and copy the token (shown only once)[1][2][3].\n\n### **C. Install Figma MCP Server**\n\n- Install globally via npm:\n  ```bash\n  npm install -g figma-developer-mcp\n  ```\n- Start the server:\n  ```bash\n  figma-developer-mcp --stdio --figma-api-key=YOUR_FIGMA_TOKEN\n  ```\n  *Replace `YOUR_FIGMA_TOKEN` with your actual token*[3].\n\n### **D. Configure Cursor IDE**\n\n- Open Cursor IDE.\n- Go to **Settings > MCP tab**.\n- Add a new global MCP server with the following configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:\n  ```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"figma-developer-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"figma-developer-mcp\", \"--stdio\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIGMA_API_KEY\": \"<your-figma-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  *Replace `<your-figma-api-key>` with your Figma token*[1][4][5].\n\n- **Verify connection:** A green dot next to the server name in Cursor indicates success[5].\n\n### **E. Using Figma MCP in Cursor**\n\n- In Figma, select your design and **Copy Link to Selection**.\n- In Cursor, open **Composer** and enable **Agent Mode**.\n- Paste the Figma link and issue commands such as:\n  - “Generate code for this design in React.”\n  - “Convert this design into reusable UI components.”\n  - “Suggest improvements for this layout.”[5]\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Key Statistics & Data Points**\n\n- **Setup time:** Most users report initial setup (including Node.js, Cursor, and MCP server) takes **15–30 minutes**[2][3].\n- **Productivity gains:** Teams using Figma MCP with Cursor report **up to 50% faster design-to-code cycles** and significant reduction in manual handoff errors (anecdotal, as formal studies are emerging)[2][5].\n- **Adoption:** Cursor IDE’s user base has grown rapidly since integrating MCP support, with thousands of developers leveraging Figma MCP for web and mobile projects[2][5].\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Relevant Examples & Case Studies**\n\n- **Web Login Page Generation:** A recent tutorial demonstrated building a fully functional login page in React directly from a Figma file using Cursor and Figma MCP, reducing implementation time from hours to minutes[2].\n- **Enterprise Teams:** Design and engineering teams at SaaS startups have adopted Figma MCP to automate repetitive UI coding tasks, freeing up developers for more complex logic and reducing design drift[5].\n- **Remote Collaboration:** With WSL and SSH support, distributed teams can run MCP servers in cloud or remote environments, enabling collaborative, real-time design-to-code workflows[3].\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Implications & Applications**\n\n- **Automated Design-to-Code:** Instantly convert Figma designs into production-ready code (React, Vue, etc.), accelerating prototyping and reducing manual translation errors[1][2][5].\n- **Component Generation:** Extract reusable UI components from Figma assets, supporting scalable design systems[5].\n- **AI Collaboration:** Use AI agents in Cursor to interpret Figma designs, suggest improvements, and generate code snippets or full components[5].\n- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on macOS, Windows (with WSL), and Linux, supporting diverse development environments[3][4].\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Key Players & Ecosystem**\n\n- **Cursor IDE:** Leading AI-powered IDE with native MCP support.\n- **Figma:** Popular collaborative design platform with robust API.\n- **figma-developer-mcp:** Open-source MCP server for Figma integration.\n- **Other Tools:** Windsurf, Cline, Claude Desktop—expanding the MCP ecosystem[5].\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Actionable Insights**\n\n- **For Developers:** Automate UI implementation by integrating Figma MCP with Cursor; leverage AI agents for rapid prototyping.\n- **For Teams:** Standardize design handoff with MCP workflows to minimize errors and accelerate delivery.\n- **For Enterprises:** Invest in MCP-based pipelines to scale design systems and improve cross-functional collaboration.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] cursorideguide.com  \n[2] marktechpost.com  \n[3] mcpevals.io  \n[4] forum.cursor.com  \n[5] apidog.com",
