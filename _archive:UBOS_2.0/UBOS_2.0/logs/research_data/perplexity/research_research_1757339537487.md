## Current Status & Recent Developments

- **Claude Code** is Anthropic’s advanced AI coding assistant, designed for deep IDE integration, context-aware suggestions, and intelligent code generation[2][4].
- **Cursor IDE**, a popular VSCode fork, is not automatically detected by Claude Code due to missing IDE signatures, but it fully supports VSIX extensions[2].
- As of mid-2025, official installation methods often fail for Cursor, but manual VSIX installation is a proven workaround with a 100% success rate[2][1][5].

## Installation Steps: Claude Code in Cursor IDE

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed locally (via npm or direct download).
- **Cursor IDE** installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Verify Claude Code Installation**
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     claude
     ```
   - If installed, you’ll enter the Claude Code interactive session[1][3].
   - Run:
     ```bash
     /doctor
     ```
   - Confirm the installation path (e.g., `~/.claude/local`)[1][3].

2. **Manual VSIX Installation (Recommended)**
   - Exit the Claude Code session.
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     cursor --install-extension ~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/vendor/claude-code.vsix
     ```
   - You should see confirmation: “Extension 'claude-code.vsix' was successfully installed.”[1][2]

3. **Restart Cursor IDE**
   - Fully close and reopen Cursor IDE to activate the extension[4][5].

4. **Connect Claude Code to Cursor**
   - In Cursor’s integrated terminal, run:
     ```bash
     claude
     ```
   - Use `/ide` or `/status` commands to check integration status[3][4].
   - If not detected, confirm extension installation and restart IDE.

### Troubleshooting

- If Cursor IDE is not detected:
  - Ensure the VSIX extension is installed and IDE is restarted[3].
  - Use `/doctor` and `/status` commands for diagnostics[3].
  - For remote or WSL setups, follow additional configuration steps as per Anthropic’s docs[4].
