  "response": "**Codex CLI timeout after 30000ms when creating Figma MCP investor pitch deck template** is a symptom of integration and performance challenges at the intersection of Figma’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, agentic code generation tools, and complex design automation workflows. This research synthesizes the current landscape, technical context, key players, and practical solutions, with a focus on recent developments and actionable insights.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Current Status & Recent Developments\n\n- **Figma MCP Server Beta (2025):**\n  - Figma’s Dev Mode MCP server, launched in public beta in early 2025, enables direct integration between Figma and agentic coding tools (e.g., Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code) for design-informed code generation[3][1].\n  - The protocol allows LLMs and agents to access structured design data, improving automation and reducing reliance on screenshots or manual API parsing[3][1].\n  - **Performance optimizations** (e.g., LRU caching, connection pooling) have reduced latency for cached responses to under 100ms, with typical processing speeds of 2–5 seconds for design files[1].\n\n- **API Rate Limits & Resource Constraints:**\n  - Figma API imposes limits: ~6,000 credits/minute (1.2M/day), with file access costing 50 credits and image rendering 200 credits[1].\n  - Memory usage for MCP servers ranges from 150–300MB (base) to 1–2GB for complex files[1].\n\n- **Timeout Issues:**\n  - **Codex CLI timeout after 30000ms** (30 seconds) is often triggered by:\n    - Large or complex Figma files exceeding processing capacity.\n    - Network latency or suboptimal server configuration.\n    - Inefficient request formats or endpoint misconfiguration[2].\n  - Workarounds include using the `/sse` endpoint for more reliable streaming responses, as the `/mcp` endpoint may be unstable or require additional headers/metadata in current beta versions[2].\n\n- **Roadmap & Future Features:**\n  - Figma’s roadmap includes remote server capabilities, deeper codebase integration, simplified setup, and advanced agentic workflows (multi-step, hierarchical agent coordination)[1][3].\n  - The MCP protocol is evolving toward industry standardization, with registry systems, enhanced security, and AI-to-AI collaboration features planned[1].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Players & Ecosystem\n\n- **Figma:** Leading design platform, now supporting MCP server for agentic workflows[3].\n- **Cursor AI:** Early adopter, integrating MCP for programmatic design reading and modification[5].\n- **Copilot, Claude Code, Windsurf:** AI coding tools leveraging MCP for design-to-code automation[3][4].\n- **OpenAI Codex:** LLM-based code generation tool; CLI timeouts highlight integration bottlenecks with complex agent tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Technical Architecture & Workflow\n\n- **MCP Architecture:**\n  - **Host:** Manages discovery and permissions (e.g., OS or desktop app).\n  - **Client:** Maintains connection to MCP server, relays requests/responses.\n  - **Server:** Interfaces with external systems (Figma), translates requests, and standardizes responses[4].\n\n- **Integration Example:**\n  - Cursor’s MCP integration with Figma enables:\n    - Bulk text content replacement in designs.\n    - Propagation of component instance overrides across multiple targets, reducing repetitive work[5].\n  - Setup involves running a WebSocket server, installing the MCP server, and connecting the Figma plugin for real-time communication[5].\n\n---\n\n## 4. Case Studies & Examples\n\n- **Bulk Design Automation:**\n  - Cursor’s MCP integration demonstrates automated bulk text replacement and instance override propagation, significantly accelerating repetitive design tasks[5].\n- **Enterprise Deployments:**\n  - Organizations report high cache hit ratios (85–95%) and component reuse rates above 80% when integrating Figma MCP with mature design systems[1].\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Statistics & Data Points\n\n- **LLM Token Consumption:** Reduced by 30–50% via structured MCP data vs. screenshots[1].\n- **API Rate Limits:** 6,000 credits/minute; 1.2M/day; 50 credits/file access; 200 credits/image render[1].\n- **Performance:** 2–5 seconds average processing per design file; <100ms for cached responses[1].\n- **Memory Usage:** 150–300MB (base); 1–2GB (complex files)[1].\n- **Component Reuse:** >80% with Code Connect and design system integration[1].\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical Implications & Solutions\n\n- **Timeout Mitigation:**\n  - Optimize Figma files (reduce complexity, flatten hierarchies).\n  - Use local MCP server deployments with caching to minimize latency[1].\n  - Prefer `/sse` endpoint for streaming, as `/mcp` may be unstable in current beta[2].\n  - Monitor API credit usage to avoid throttling.\n\n- **Agent Implementation:**\n  - Leverage advanced agentic workflows (multi-step, hierarchical) as they become available[1].\n  - Integrate with design systems for higher component reuse and automation efficiency[1].\n\n- **Development Best Practices:**\n  - Ensure proper authentication and request formatting for MCP endpoints[2].\n  - Stay updated with Figma’s MCP server releases and migration timelines[3].\n\n---\n\n## 7. Challenges & Open Questions\n\n- **Endpoint Stability:** `/mcp` endpoint may not be fully implemented; `/sse` is a reliable interim solution[2].\n- **Session Management:** Automatic TTL and resource cleanup are essential for scaling[1].\n- **Security & Permissions:** Ongoing improvements in protocol-level security and access control[1][4].\n\n---\n\n## 8. Actionable Insights\n\n- **For Developers:** Use local MCP servers with caching, monitor API usage, and prefer stable endpoints. Prepare for rapid protocol evolution and integrate with design systems for best results.\n- **For Enterprises:** Invest in design system maturity and Code Connect mapping to maximize automation and reuse.\n- **For Tool Builders:** Track Figma’s roadmap for remote server support and advanced agentic workflows; contribute feedback to shape protocol development[3].\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**  \n[1] UX Writing Hub: Figma MCP Server Vibe Coding  \n[2] Figma Forum: MCP Not Working  \n[3] Figma Blog: Dev Mode MCP Server  \n[4] Figma Resource Library: What is MCP?  \n[5] GitHub: Cursor Talk to Figma MCP",
