      "output": "System capability analysis involves quantifying how well a system performs against defined requirements, typically using statistical techniques and structured evaluation frameworks[3][5]. The process requires reliable data, clear specifications, and careful consideration of statistical assumptions to ensure meaningful results[3][5].\n\n**Key methodologies and synthesis:**\n\n- **Statistical Capability Analysis:**  \n  This approach assesses whether a system consistently meets specification limits. Common indices include **Cp** (process capability ratio), **Cpk** (process capability index, accounting for process centering), and **Cpm** (for non-normal data)[5]. Values above 1.33 for Cp and Cpk are generally considered acceptable, indicating the system reliably meets requirements[5]. The analysis assumes stable processes, normal data distribution, and sufficient sample size; violations of these assumptions can limit reliability[3][5].\n\n- **AI Capability Assessment:**  \n  For AI systems, capability is measured by evaluating performance across tasks of varying difficulty under controlled conditions. Success rates at each difficulty level are plotted to generate a **capability performance curve**, illustrating how performance changes with complexity[1]. Multiple evaluation runs are recommended to account for performance variability[1].\n\n- **Systems Perspective in Evidence Synthesis:**  \n  When analyzing complex systems, a systems perspective helps understand dynamic, nonlinear interactions. Reviews using this lens frame topics, generate hypotheses, and guide analysis, often employing thematic summaries and visualization tools to map system elements and interactions[4].\n\n**Essential steps for capability analysis:**\n- Define clear specifications and requirements.\n- Collect measured data over time, ensuring stability and normality where possible[3][5].\n- Use appropriate capability indices (Cp, Cpk, Cpm) and visualize data with histograms or control charts[5].\n- For AI, run multiple evaluations at each difficulty level and plot performance curves[1].\n- For complex systems, consider systems-based synthesis to capture interactions and emergent behaviors[4].\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Capability analysis is less reliable if processes are unstable, data is non-normal, or sample sizes are inadequate[3][5].\n- Systems synthesis may face challenges in mapping complex, nonlinear interactions and requires careful methodological choices[4].\n\nIn summary, robust system capability analysis relies on statistical rigor, repeated and controlled evaluations, and—where appropriate—a systems perspective to capture complexity and dynamic interactions[1][3][4][5].",
