# Implementation Roadmap (EUFM Enterprise Orchestration)

Time-bound, incremental delivery aligned to multi-tenant SaaS, real-time monitoring, and enterprise security. Suggested tech: TypeScript/Node.js, PostgreSQL(+Timescale), Redis, NATS/Kafka, Kubernetes.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Week 0–2)
- Architecture baselines: repo structure, CI/CD, envs (dev/staging/prod)
- Core packages: API service, Orchestration service, Adapter interfaces
- Observability scaffolding: OpenTelemetry, structured logging, metrics
- Security baseline: secrets management, KMS envelopes, lint + SAST
- Deliverables: Architectural docs, runbooks, env bootstrap

Acceptance: Services boot locally and in staging; health checks green; CI/CD deploys.

## Phase 1 — Multi-tenant Core (Week 2–5)
- DB schema (tenants, environments, users, RBAC, API keys)
- Tenant scoping middleware (JWT + `X-Tenant-Id`, `X-Env-Id`)
- RBAC enforcement for REST/GraphQL resolvers
- API keys issuance (prefix + hash), rotation, revocation
- Audit logging for authn/z, config changes

Acceptance: Tenant isolation verified with unit/integration tests; audit logs captured.

## Phase 2 — Orchestration & Routing (Week 5–8)
- Orchestration engine (tasks, retries, backoff, idempotency)
- Routing engine (cost/latency/SLA strategies; policy JSON)
- Provider adapter SDK (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity)
- Intelligent caching and rate limits (Redis)
- Queue-backed execution (NATS/Kafka + workers)

Acceptance: Golden path `POST /v1/orchestrate` across at least 3 providers with parity tests.

## Phase 3 — Real-time Monitoring (Week 8–10)
- Event gateway (WS/SSE) with multi-tenant auth
- Request/Task events stream; subscribe via `/v1/events`
- Metrics aggregation jobs (TimescaleDB optional)
- Alerting (thresholds + anomaly hooks) and webhooks

Acceptance: Live dashboard shows tasks and provider latencies; alerts fire to Slack/webhook.

## Phase 4 — Enterprise Security (Week 10–12)
- SSO (OIDC baseline; later SAML)
- Fine-grained permissions; role templates per plan
- Data residency controls (EU/US routing, storage policies)
- SIEM exports; signed audit logs; retention policies

Acceptance: SOC2-ready controls checklist; SIEM forwarding validated.

## Phase 5 — Analytics & Billing (Week 12–14)
- Usage and cost aggregation; budgets and limits
- Stripe integration; plan enforcement (rate/token quotas)
- Cost optimization insights (model mix, cache hits)

Acceptance: Trial-to-paid flows; budget alerts; invoice reconciliation against usage.

## Phase 6 — Workflow Designer & SDKs (Week 14–18)
- Workflow definitions (JSON DAG/state machine) and versioning
- Visual designer (incremental) in dashboard
- SDKs (TS first) with retries, backoff, tracing context propagation

Acceptance: Complex multi-agent workflow runs with branching and compensation steps.

## Non-functional Milestones
- Performance: p95 < 300ms orchestrate passthrough; workers scalable to 10k RPS
- Reliability: 99.9% SLO; graceful degradation, provider failover tested
- Security: Regular pentests; dependency policy gates; secrets rotation
