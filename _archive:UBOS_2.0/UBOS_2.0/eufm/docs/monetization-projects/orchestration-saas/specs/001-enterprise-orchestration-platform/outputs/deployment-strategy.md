# Deployment Strategy (EUFM Enterprise Orchestration)

Target: Highly-available, secure, multi-region SaaS with real-time monitoring.

## Platform & Topology
- Kubernetes (GKE/EKS/AKS), multi-AZ per region; cluster-per-environment
- Namespaces per environment; network policies (deny-all by default)
- API ingress via managed gateway + WAF + DDoS protection
- WebSocket/SSE through dedicated edge (sticky sessions or pub/sub fanout)

## Data Stores
- PostgreSQL (managed; HA, PITR). Optional TimescaleDB for time-series
- Redis (managed) for cache, rate limits, locks
- Object storage (S3/GCS) for logs/artifacts
- Event bus (NATS/Kafka/Redpanda) for decoupled events

## Security & Compliance
- Identity: OIDC (Auth0/Azure AD/Entra) with SCIM for provisioning; add SAML later
- RBAC: Kubernetes RBAC + application RBAC (roles/permissions)
- Secrets: External Secrets Operator + cloud KMS envelope encryption
- Data residency: region-tagged tenants; routing/storage policies enforced
- Network: Private subnets, VPC peering/PrivateLink for enterprise traffic
- Audit: Immutable logs shipped to SIEM; tamper-evident (hash-chained)

## CI/CD & Release Management
- Branch-protected main; PR checks (lint, test, typecheck, SAST)
- Container build with SBOM + signatures (Cosign), provenance (SLSA)
- Progressive delivery: blue/green for API, canary for workers
- Database migrations via declarative tool (e.g., Prisma/Migrate or Sqitch)

## Observability
- OpenTelemetry tracing; logs to ELK/OpenSearch; metrics to Prometheus
- Golden signals dashboards: latency, errors, traffic, saturation
- SLOs w/ alert policies; anomaly detection for provider latencies/cost spikes

## Resilience & DR
- Provider failover: routing engine supports multi-provider with healthchecks
- Regional resilience: active-active events; DB active-passive with read replicas
- Backups: nightly full + WAL; quarterly restore drills

## Runtime Policies
- Pod security standards, seccomp, read-only FS, non-root
- Resource quotas/limits per namespace; HPA/VPA for autoscaling
- Rate limiting and quotas per tenant/environment at gateway and app layers

## Go-live Checklist
- Pen test findings remediated; SOC2 controls mapped
- Performance test at 2x projected load; chaos drills for provider outages
- Runbooks and on-call rotation established; escalation policies configured
