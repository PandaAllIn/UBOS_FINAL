# Optimization Strategies

Goals: minimize variable spend, avoid hard caps, and match workflows to the most cost‑effective provider or tier.

General tips
- Prefer subscription web UIs for general Q&A if you already pay (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro) to reduce per‑token API costs.
- Reserve API usage for automation, batch jobs, or integrations that cannot be done via the web UI.
- Use smaller/cheaper models for high‑volume tasks; save premium models for complex prompts.
- Consolidate workloads to utilize included quotas of one provider before spilling over to others.
- Monitor usage weekly; adjust tiers if you consistently under/over‑use limits.

ChatGPT Plus
- Route general research/browsing tasks to ChatGPT sessions.
- Keep API calls for server automations and structured workflows.

Claude Pro
- Use Claude web for long‑form writing and multi‑turn reasoning, especially when API token costs rise.
- Consider Claude API for deterministic automations where you can control inputs and batching.

Perplexity Pro
- Favor Perplexity for rapid, cite‑backed research; batch research questions where possible.
- If you pay for ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro, consider offloading simpler queries to those subscriptions during heavy periods.

Abacus.ai
- Shift batch/offline inference to Abacus when you have unused monthly tokens.
- Benchmark model quality vs. cost for your specific tasks; mix providers based on strengths.

Alerts and upgrades/downgrades
- If approaching 80% of a cap, preemptively plan overflow handling (alternate provider, smaller model).
- If using <20% of tier capacity for multiple months, consider downgrading.
