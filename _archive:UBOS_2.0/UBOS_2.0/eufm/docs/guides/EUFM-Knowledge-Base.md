- Integrations: [[../integration_adapters.md]]
- Funding Notes: [[../funding_eu.md]]
- Agent Capabilities: [[../agent_browser_access.md]]

## Usage
- Keep notes concise, link liberally, and prefer plain Markdown.
- Avoid toolâ€‘specific features that reduce portability.
- Store local project knowledge here; external references go in `docs/`.

## Capture Ideas
- [ ] Open questions
- [ ] Risks and mitigations
- [ ] Next steps
