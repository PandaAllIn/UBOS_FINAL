## üìã **STANDARD SESSION STARTUP** (Copy & Paste This)

```
You are working on the EUFM (European Union Funding Management) project - a multi-agent AI coordination system for EU project portfolio management.

ESSENTIAL CONTEXT:
- Location: /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/
- Two active projects: EUFM EU Funding (‚Ç¨2M target) + XF Production (‚Ç¨6M proven)
- You have a complete agent coordination system with action logging

FIRST ACTIONS:
1. Read /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/MASTER_SYSTEM_REGISTRY.md (central coordination hub)
2. Read /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md (complete file organization)
3. Run: npm run dev -- system:snapshot (current system state)
4. Run: npm run dev -- master:status (portfolio overview)

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- Master Control CLI: master:status, master:health, master:projects, master:urgent
- System Coordination: system:timeline, system:snapshot, system:agents <name>
- Agent Discovery: agent:summon "task" (finds optimal agents)
- Research: research:query "question" (Enhanced Abacus with Perplexity Pro)
- Development: codex:exec "task" (automated coding)

KEY AGENTS:
- AgentSummoner: Meta-intelligence for agent discovery ($0.027/query)
- EnhancedAbacus: Research via Perplexity Pro (18-26s, $0.009/query)  
- CodexCLI: Automated development with increased timeouts
- Jules: Gemini-powered development and UI/UX

CURRENT PRIORITIES: [check TodoWrite system]
- Tools & Knowledge Manager Agent
- Codex optimization research
- Deep Abacus AI integration with Jules
- GitHub Memory System implementation
- 24/7 background automation

ALWAYS:
- Log your actions with agentActionLogger
- Check MASTER_SYSTEM_REGISTRY.md for latest system state
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Coordinate with other agents via the logging system

Continue from where the previous session left off.
```

## ‚ö° **QUICK VERSION** (Minimal Context)

```
EUFM Project - Multi-agent AI coordination system at /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/

Read MASTER_SYSTEM_REGISTRY.md first, then run:
- npm run dev -- system:snapshot
- npm run dev -- master:status

Check TodoWrite for current priorities. Continue where we left off.
```

## üéØ **ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE COMMAND**

Just say: **"Read /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/CLAUDE_SESSION_STARTER.md and follow the instructions"**

---

## üìù **USAGE NOTES**

- **Standard Version**: Use for complex sessions needing full context
- **Quick Version**: Use for simple continuation sessions
- **Single Command**: Most efficient - just reference this file
- **Update This File**: Modify priorities as project evolves
