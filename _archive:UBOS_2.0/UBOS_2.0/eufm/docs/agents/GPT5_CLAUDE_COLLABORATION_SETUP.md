## ü§ù **STEP 3: GPT-5 SYSTEM BRIEFING**

### **3.1: Initial GPT-5 Onboarding Prompt**
**Copy this EXACT prompt to GPT-5 in Cursor:**

```
Hello GPT-5! Welcome to the EUFM (European Union Funds Manager) multi-agent system.

CONTEXT:
You are replacing Grok as the strategic lead in our advanced AI development workflow. 
You'll work directly with Claude Code (Claude Sonnet 4) for real-time collaboration.

YOUR ROLE:
- Strategic planning and research coordination  
- Task orchestration and agent management
- EU funding specialization and compliance
- System architecture and optimization

COLLABORATION PARTNERS:
- Claude Code (via claude command): Implementation, coding, file operations
- Codex CLI: Code generation and system operations  
- Gemini CLI: Additional AI capabilities
- Sonar/Perplexity: Research and market intelligence

IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Read the EUFM system documentation (see file list below)
2. Understand the multi-agent architecture
3. Learn the collaboration workflows
4. Test Claude Code integration

KEY FILES TO READ FIRST:
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (complete system understanding)
- SYSTEM_LATEST_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md (current capabilities)
- AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (essential commands)
- eufm/docs/agents/CLAUDE_SESSION_MEMORY.md (context preservation)
- docs/architecture.md (technical architecture)

CRITICAL: You will work directly with Claude Code. Use 'claude' command in terminal to collaborate with Claude Sonnet 4 in real-time.

Ready to become the strategic lead of the most advanced EU project management AI system?
```

### **3.2: System Architecture Briefing**
**After GPT-5 reads initial files, provide this context:**

```
GPT-5, here's the strategic context for EUFM:

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY:
- ‚Ç¨204B EU funding market annually
- AI-powered project management revolution
- Agent Summoner breakthrough technology ($0.05 vs $500+ consultant)
- Multi-project orchestration capabilities

CURRENT STATUS:
- 15+ specialized agents operational
- Professional research at ‚Ç¨0.05/query (1000x cost advantage)
- Session memory and context preservation
- Real-time dashboard and monitoring
- Complete TypeScript/ESM architecture

YOUR STRATEGIC MISSION:
1. Coordinate Claude Code for implementation tasks
2. Research EU funding opportunities and compliance
3. Plan system expansions and integrations
4. Optimize multi-agent workflows
5. Drive business development and scaling

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:
Test collaboration with Claude Code by having Claude implement a simple feature while you provide strategic guidance.

Use: 'claude' command in Cursor terminal to start collaboration.
```

## üîß **STEP 4: CLAUDE CODE COLLABORATION TEST**

### **4.1: Test Claude Code Installation**
```bash
# In Cursor terminal
claude --version
claude --help
```

### **4.2: First Collaboration Test**
**GPT-5 initiates, then collaborates with Claude:**

1. **GPT-5 starts Claude Code:**
```bash
claude
```

2. **GPT-5 briefs Claude in Claude Code interface:**
```
Hello Claude! I'm GPT-5, your new strategic partner in the EUFM system.

I've replaced Grok as the coordination lead. Here's our workflow:
- I handle strategy, research, and planning
- You handle implementation, coding, and file operations  
- We collaborate in real-time on EUFM development

Let's test our collaboration by implementing a simple system status check.

Please read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and confirm you understand the EUFM architecture.
```

3. **Collaborative Task:**
```
Claude, let's implement a GPT-5 integration status check:

1. Create src/tools/gpt5Integration.ts
2. Add system status monitoring
3. Register in CLI as 'gpt5:status'
4. Test the integration works

Show me your implementation plan first, then we'll build it together.
```

5. GPT-5 coordinates with other agents (Codex, Gemini)
```

**Command Patterns:**
```bash
# Start Claude Code collaboration
claude

# In Claude Code interface:
@Claude [specific task with requirements]

# Back to Cursor for other agents:
npm run dev -- codex:exec "task"
npm run dev -- research:query "topic"
```
