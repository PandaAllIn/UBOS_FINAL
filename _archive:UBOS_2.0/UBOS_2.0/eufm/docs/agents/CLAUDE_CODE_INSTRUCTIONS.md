# Claude Code Task Brief: EUFM System Analysis

Purpose
- Provide an expert assessment of the latest EUFM (European Union Funds Manager) system developments with a focus on: multi‑agent architecture, MCP integrations, and business potential.
- Read the specified project documents first, then deliver a concise, opinionated report with actionable recommendations.

Project Context
- Working directory: `/Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM`
- Project type: TypeScript/Node.js multi‑agent orchestration system
- Core pattern: `BaseAgent` in `src/agents/baseAgent.ts`
- Agent registration: `AgentFactory` in `src/orchestrator/agentFactory.ts`

Primary Documents To Read (in order)
1) `GROK_TEAM_PRESENTATION.md`
2) `SYSTEM_STATUS_MASTER.md`
3) `FIGMA_MCP_WORKFLOW.md`
4) `GEMINI_CLI_SETUP.md`
5) `CURSOR_IDE_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md`
6) `CLAUDE_CODE_ORIENTATION.md`

What To Deliver
- Create a single report file at the repo root named: `CLAUDE_EUFM_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Audience: EUFM engineering + business stakeholders.
- Tone: clear, pragmatic, opinionated; prioritize actionable guidance.

Required Report Structure
1) Executive Summary (≤ 200 words)
   - One paragraph with the most important conclusions and near‑term actions.
2) Multi‑Agent Architecture Assessment
   - How well the system follows the `BaseAgent` pattern and uses `AgentFactory`.
   - Orchestration quality (task routing, capability mapping, context/memory use).
   - Strengths, gaps, and top 3 architectural improvements.
3) MCP Integrations Review
   - Current/planned MCP servers and tools (e.g., Figma Developer MCP, Stripe, Gemini CLI).
   - Integration readiness, risks, and concrete next steps (auth, rate limits, error handling).
   - Proposed validation steps for each integration.
4) Business Potential & GTM
   - Monetization paths (EU funding advisory, proposal automation, dashboards, MCP‑powered design outputs).
   - Competitive advantages/risks; top 3 experiments to validate market demand.
   - Metrics to track (activation, conversion, retention, deal velocity).
5) Risks & Mitigations
   - Technical, operational, legal/compliance, and product risks with mitigations.
6) 30/60/90‑Day Roadmap (engineering + BD)
   - 30 days: must‑do items for system stability + a revenue pilot.
   - 60 days: scale integrations, add observability, expand BD motions.
   - 90 days: productionization, SLAs, pricing experiments.
7) Appendix: Source References
   - Bullet references to the above files you drew from, citing file names and brief section labels. Use quotes sparingly where helpful. No external links required.

Critical Constraints & Safety
- Preserve existing functionality; do not make code changes in this analysis task.
- If proposing code changes as follow‑ups, you must:
  - Follow TypeScript best practices and the `BaseAgent` pattern in `src/agents/`.
  - Register any new agent types in `src/orchestrator/agentFactory.ts`.
  - Add proper error handling (try/catch for async ops) and logging.
  - Include basic tests or a minimal validation plan for new behavior.
  - Avoid large refactors; prefer small, safe, reversible steps.

Execution Protocol (Time‑boxed)
1) Preparation (1–2 minutes)
   - Skim file list, confirm paths, open the six documents.
2) Analysis (5–7 minutes)
   - Extract key architecture patterns, integration plans, and business theses.
   - Note inconsistencies, missing pieces, and risks.
3) Synthesis (1–2 minutes)
   - Draft the report with concrete, prioritized recommendations.
   - Keep the executive summary crisp and directive.

Quality Bar & Acceptance Criteria
- Coverage: Addresses all three focus areas (architecture, MCP, business).
- Specificity: Calls out file‑based evidence and concrete next steps.
- Prioritization: Includes a clear top‑3 list in architecture and MCP sections.
- Actionability: Roadmap items are small, testable, and sequenced.
- Clarity: The executive summary stands alone for leadership review.

Helpful Code Map (read‑only reference)
- `src/agents/baseAgent.ts` — mandatory abstract class and typing.
- `src/orchestrator/agentFactory.ts` — where new agents are registered.
- `src/orchestrator/capabilityMapper.ts` — capabilities → routing hints.
- `src/orchestrator/strategicOrchestrator.ts` — high‑level orchestration flow.
- `src/agents/figmaMCPAgent.ts` — current Figma MCP implementation details.

Output Formatting
- Use clear section headers and short bullet points.
- Avoid overly long paragraphs; keep bullets actionable.
- Where helpful, include short code or path snippets in backticks.

Optional Follow‑Up Tasks (separate from this analysis)
- Draft a lightweight “ClaudeAnalysisAgent” that implements `BaseAgent` to generate this report on demand; register in `AgentFactory`.
- Add a minimal test that runs the agent in dry‑run mode and validates report sections exist.

Notes
- You may reference additional repo docs if needed, but the six files listed above are the required sources for this analysis.
- Do not run builds or alter configuration as part of this task; this is a documentation deliverable only.
