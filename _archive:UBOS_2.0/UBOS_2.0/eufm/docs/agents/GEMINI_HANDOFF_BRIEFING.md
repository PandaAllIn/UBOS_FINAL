## 🚨 **CRITICAL NOTES**

### **DO NOT:**
- Make major strategic changes without human approval
- Contact clients directly (prepare materials for human to send)
- Modify core agent architectures without documentation
- Break existing working systems while improving them

### **DO PRIORITIZE:**
- **Notion workspace completion** (this is the control center!)
- **Real data integration** (no more mock data)
- **Business execution preparation** (Monday is critical)
- **Documentation of all changes** (for seamless handoffs)

### **EMERGENCY CONTACTS:**
If you encounter blocker issues:
1. **Check logs**: /Users/panda/Desktop/EUFM/logs/
2. **Verify system status**: npm run dev -- master:status  
3. **Document the issue**: Create detailed issue report
4. **Continue with other tasks**: Don't let one issue block everything
