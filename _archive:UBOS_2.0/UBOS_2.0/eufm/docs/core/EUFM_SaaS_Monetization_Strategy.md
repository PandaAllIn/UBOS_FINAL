# EUFM (European Union Funds Manager) — SaaS Monetization Strategy for EU Funding Consultants

Version: 1.0 • Owner: Growth/Monetization • Last updated: {{today}}

This is an executable business plan for EUFM — an AI Agent Orchestration System focused on EU funding consultants. It is structured to plug into a product-led, automation-first operating model with minimal manual intervention. Each section includes automation workflows, KPIs, and data schemas to operationalize the strategy.

Note: All automation steps refer to generally available SaaS tools and can be orchestrated by n8n/Zapier, GitHub Actions, or internal Node/TypeScript workers. Replace tool placeholders with actual stack choices during implementation.

## 1) Competitive Market Analysis

### Market Overview (EU funding services tooling)
- Segments:
  - AI research assistants for calls (Horizon Europe, EIC, LIFE, Erasmus+, Digital Europe, CEF).
  - Grant discovery and alerts (EU calls databases, tender portals, RSS/email alerts).
  - Proposal automation (templates, boilerplates, form filling, compliance checks, budgeting aids).
  - Grant/consultancy CRM and workflow tools (pipeline, tasks, collaboration, submissions calendar).
  - Partner matchmaking and consortium building.

### Representative Players and Patterns
- Discovery/Alerts: EUcalls, EUFunds, Tender platforms (TED), Cordis; pricing €30–€150/mo; mostly listing/alerts.
- Proposal/Grant Management: Submittable, Foundant, Flexi-Grant (mostly US/NGO skewed), Instrumentl (US-leaning); €100–€400+/seat; limited EU framework depth.
- AI Assistants: Emerging niche tools, LLM prompt layers, few with deep EU regulation context and workbench automations.
- Consulting Boutiques’ Internal Tools: Sheets, Notion, ClickUp/Asana, off-the-shelf CRMs; highly manual, little AI orchestration, not productized.

### Gaps EUFM Addresses
- EU-specific ontology and compliance reasoning (eligibility, TRL, consortium rules).
- End-to-end agentic workflow: discovery → eligibility scoring → partner match → draft → budget consistency → submission prep.
- API-first and white-label for agencies; secure workspace per client; granular access.
- Evidence grounding and citation of call text; audit trails for accuracy.

### Market Size (Directional)
- TAM (EU institutions/companies/academia pursuing EU funds): 100k–200k org units; consultants (freelance + agencies) ~60k–80k in EU.
- SAM (active EU funding consultants and boutiques): ~25k–35k.
- SOM (reachable via PLG + partnerships in 12–24 months): 1.5k–4k paying seats.

### Risks
- Policy shifts in EU programs; portal changes.
- Data access restrictions; anti-scraping policies.
- Consultant perception of AI as competitive threat.

### Mitigations
- Focus on public call data and customer-provided materials only; respect portals’ ToS.
- Evidence citations and human-in-the-loop review checkpoints.
- Position EUFM as an exoskeleton for consultants, not a replacement.

KPIs
- Competitive win notes stored in CRM, loss reasons coverage >70%.
- Sales objection library utilization rate.

Personas
- Lead Consultant: pipeline owner; cares about hit rate, time-to-first-draft.
- Proposal Writer: speed, accuracy, template reuse.
- Engagement Manager: portfolio visibility, margin control, standardization.
- Compliance Officer/DPO: GDPR, auditability, data residency.

Buying Triggers
- New call cycles; team growth; lost tenders; need to scale marginably without headcount.

## 9) Competitive Positioning vs Existing Solutions

Positioning Map
- X-axis: EU specificity/compliance depth; Y-axis: automation level.

Differentiators
- Agentic workflows across full lifecycle, not just discovery or templates.
- Evidence-grounded outputs and audit logs.
- White-label + API for agencies; role granularity per client workspace.
- Faster time-to-draft with eligibility and budget consistency checks.

Comparison Notes
- vs Discovery Platforms (EUcalls, etc.): broader functionality, integrated drafting/CRM; price premium justified by outcomes.
- vs US-centric Grant Tools (Instrumentl, Submittable): deeper EU framework knowledge and compliance; consultant-focused workflows.
- vs In-house Toolchains: lower integration overhead, standardized templates, cross-client reuse, governance layer.

Proof Assets
- Funded proposal case studies, time saved metrics, win-rate uplift after 3 months.

## Executable Workflows (Automation-First Blueprints)

This section defines automation blueprints that engineering can map to TypeScript workers and external tools. Use consistent event names and idempotent job design.

Event Schema (examples)
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "workspaceId": "uuid",

  "properties": {
    "callId": "he-2025-health-xx",
    "timeToDraftMinutes": 18,
    "evidenceCitations": 6
  },
  "context": { "plan": "Pro", "locale": "de-DE" },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- Data accuracy of calls → source-of-truth sync jobs, human verification for high-traffic pages.
- Over-automation fatigue → guardrails and opt-outs; measure helpful vs intrusive nudges.
- Vendor lock-in → choose interoperable tools; export endpoints.

---

## Implementation Notes for Engineering (TypeScript/Node.js)

- Emit analytics events from server-side to prevent spoofing; queue with retry and backoff.
- Idempotent job processors for workflows; deduplicate by `eventId`.
- Errors: structured logging (JSON), correlation IDs; capture in Sentry; PII scrubbing.
- Feature flags for pricing gates and nudges; environment-driven configs.
- Respect robots.txt and ToS; only public data ingestion; throttle crawlers; cache results.
