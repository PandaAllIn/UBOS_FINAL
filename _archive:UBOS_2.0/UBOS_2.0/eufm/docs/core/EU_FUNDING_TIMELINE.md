## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCIES

### **Critical Risk Timeline**
```yaml
High Risk Periods:
  Sept 9-12, 2025: Consortium formation window
  Sept 16-18, 2025: Submission deadline pressure
  Nov-Dec 2025: Evaluation uncertainty period
  Feb-Apr 2026: Infrastructure deployment challenges
```

### **Contingency Plans by Timeline**
```yaml
September 2025 - If Consortium Formation Fails:
  Backup: EIC Accelerator solo application
  Timeline: Immediate pivot, application by Oct 31
  Budget Impact: Reduced to €2.5M but still viable

December 2025 - If Horizon Europe Unsuccessful:
  Backup: Digital Europe Programme + Cascade Funding
  Timeline: Applications in Q1 2026
  Budget Impact: €500K-700K combined, delayed but sufficient

March 2026 - If Infrastructure Delays:
  Backup: Cloud-based deployment with EU region compliance
  Timeline: 3-month delay acceptable
  Budget Impact: Shift CAPEX to OPEX, neutral overall
```
