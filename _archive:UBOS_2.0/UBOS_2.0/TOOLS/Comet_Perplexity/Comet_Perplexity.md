### 1. Overview & Purpose

**What it does:**  
Comet enhances web browsing by combining AI-driven search, summarization, planning, and action execution directly within the browser. It allows users to interact with web content conversationally, manage tabs via natural language, and get contextual insights without switching apps or tabs[1][2].

**Main use cases:**  
- Research and information gathering with real-time, verified AI-powered search  
- Summarizing lengthy web content instantly  
- Managing emails and calendars via Gmail integration  
- Comparing outputs from multiple AI models within one interface  
- Enhancing productivity for marketers, researchers, and knowledge workers by reducing context switching[1][3][4]
