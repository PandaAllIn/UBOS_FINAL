**Lovable** is an AI-powered web development platform designed to transform natural language prompts into fully functional, beautifully designed full-stack web applications rapidly. It targets developers and non-developers alike, enabling fast app creation, iterative refinement, and one-click deployment with strong backend and GitHub integration support[3][2].

---

### 1. Overview & Purpose

- **What it does:** Lovable converts natural language descriptions into complete web applications, including frontend UI, backend logic, authentication, and database integration.
- **Main use cases:** Rapid prototyping, building full-stack apps with authentication and data visualization, creating documentation pages, and automating web development workflows.
- **Target users:** Developers seeking accelerated development, product managers, founders, and non-technical users wanting to build apps without deep coding knowledge[3][2].

---

### 2. Installation & Setup

Lovable is primarily a cloud-based platform accessible via a web interface at [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev). There is no traditional software installation required. Setup involves:

- **Sign up / Login:** Create an account on the Lovable website.
- **Connect integrations:** Link your GitHub account for code sync and Supabase for backend/database support.
- **Start a project:** Use the prompt box or import designs (Figma, Sketch, screenshots) to begin building[4][2].

No local installation is necessary, but you can clone generated code repositories locally via GitHub integration for further development.

### 3. Core Features

- **Natural Language to Code:** Describe your app in plain English; Lovable generates frontend and backend code.
- **AI-powered iterative refinement:** Chat and Agent modes allow conversational debugging, planning, and autonomous code fixes.
- **GitHub Integration:** Sync your project code automatically with GitHub repositories for version control and collaboration.
- **Supabase Integration:** Add backend services like authentication, file storage, and databases seamlessly.
- **Design Import:** Convert Figma designs, screenshots, or sketches into functional code.
- **One-click Deployment:** Deploy your app instantly from the platform.
- **Documentation Builder:** Generate structured, user-friendly documentation pages quickly.
- **Live rendering and collaboration:** Real-time preview, undo, branching, and bug fixing by AI[2][5][4][1].

### 4. Usage Examples

- **Basic prompt to build a dashboard:**

  ```
  Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart.
  ```

- **Using Figma integration:**

  1. Design UI in Figma with Auto-Layout and clear layer names.
  2. Use Builder.io plugin in Figma to open design in Lovable.
  3. Lovable generates a fully functional app from the design[4].

- **GitHub sync command:**

  After connecting GitHub, code changes are pushed automatically; no manual commands needed.

- **Chat Mode example:**

  Ask Lovable to debug or plan features conversationally, then click "Implement the plan" to apply changes automatically[5].

### 5. API Reference & CLI Commands

Lovable does not expose a public API or CLI for direct command-line usage; it operates primarily through its web interface with AI-driven chat and agent modes.

- **Chat Mode:** Conversational interface for planning, debugging, and code suggestions.
- **Agent Mode:** Autonomous AI that reads codebase, fixes bugs, refactors, and deploys.
- **GitHub & Supabase integrations:** Managed via UI connections, no separate API calls required by users[5][7].

---

### 6. Integration Guide

- **GitHub:** Connect your GitHub account in Lovable to sync code repositories automatically. Ideal for version control and team handoffs.
- **Supabase:** Use Supabase integration for backend services like authentication, file storage, and databases without manual setup.
- **External APIs:** Lovable supports adding external APIs to extend app functionality via configuration.
- **Design tools:** Import UI designs from Figma, Sketch, or screenshots to accelerate frontend development[2][4][7].

---

### 7. Configuration

- **Authentication:** Configure user login and authentication flows via Supabase integration.
- **Environment Setup:** Manage environment variables and backend connections through Lovableâ€™s UI.
- **Settings:** Adjust project-specific settings such as deployment targets, API keys, and GitHub repository links within the platform.
- **Billing:** Agent Mode uses usage-based pricing; Chat Mode deducts credits per message[5].

---

### 8. Troubleshooting

- **Common issues:**
  - AI-generated code bugs: Use Chat Mode to debug and get step-by-step fixes.
  - Integration errors: Reconnect GitHub or Supabase accounts if sync fails.
  - Deployment failures: Check environment variables and backend configurations.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use the
