## 1. Overview & Purpose

**Windsurf** is an integrated development environment (IDE) enhanced with advanced AI capabilities. Its primary purpose is to:
- **Accelerate application development** by generating, refactoring, and debugging code across multiple files.
- **Enable real-time AI collaboration** through natural language instructions and context-aware suggestions.
- **Support multiple AI models** (including in-house and third-party LLMs) for flexible, cost-effective coding assistance.

**Main use cases:**
- Rapid prototyping and scaffolding of new applications.
- Refactoring and maintaining large codebases.
- Debugging and troubleshooting with AI guidance.
- Learning and onboarding for new codebases or technologies[1][2].

## 2. Installation & Setup

### Windows
1. **Download** the Windows installer from the official Windsurf website.
2. **Run** the installer executable and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. **Launch** Windsurf from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

### macOS
1. **Download** the macOS package.
2. **Drag** the Windsurf app to your Applications folder.
3. **Open** Windsurf from Launchpad or Finder.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
1. **Add the repository and key:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL "https://windsurf-stable.codeiumdata.com/wVxQEIWkwPUEAGf3/windsurf.gpg" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/windsurf-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/windsurf-stable-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://windsurf-stable.codeiumdata.com/wVxQEIWkwPUEAGf3/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/windsurf.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install windsurf
   ```
2. **Launch** Windsurf:
   ```bash
   windsurf
   ```
3. **Complete onboarding:** Choose to import settings (from VS Code/Cursor) or start fresh, select keybindings and theme, then sign in or create a Windsurf account[1][2].

## 3. Core Features

- **Cascade Panel:** Central AI agent that maintains deep context across your project, enabling relevant suggestions and multi-file edits.
- **AI Flows:** Real-time, collaborative workflows where you and the AI operate on the same project state.
- **Supercomplete:** Predicts intent and generates entire functions or modules, not just single lines.
- **Multi-file Editing:** AI can make consistent changes across multiple files.
- **Intelligent Indexing:** Semantic understanding of your codebase for better suggestions.
- **Write Mode:** Directly modifies code based on your instructions.
- **Chat Mode:** Provides explanations, answers, and suggestions without changing code.
- **Terminal Integration:** AI can suggest and execute terminal commands for debugging and running code.
- **Flexible Model Selection:** Choose between in-house SWE-1 models (free/paid) and third-party models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) as needed[1][2].

---

## 4. Usage Examples

### Open Cascade Panel
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl+L`
- **macOS:** `Cmd+L`

### Generate a Django To-Do App
1. Open Cascade (Write Mode).
2. Enter:  
   ```
   Create a to-do app by using django framework
   ```
3. Review and accept the generated code.

### Refactor a Function
1. Highlight the function.
2. In Cascade, type:  
   ```
   Refactor this function for better readability and add docstrings.
   ```

### Generate HTML Structure
```
Generate the index.html file with a semantic HTML5 structure for a meditation app.
```
Windsurf will create the file and you can review/edit as needed[1].

## 5. API Reference

### CLI Commands
- `windsurf`  
  Launches the IDE.

### Cascade Panel Commands
- **Write Mode:**  
  - `"Generate a REST API endpoint for user authentication."`
  - `"Add unit tests for the payment module."`
- **Chat Mode:**  
  - `"Explain how this function works."`
  - `"Why am I getting a KeyError here?"`

### Model Selection
- Switch models via the Cascade panel or settings:
  - `"Switch to GPT-4 for this session."`
  - `"Use SWE-1 Lite for autocomplete."`[2]

## 6. Integration Guide

- **Import Settings:** During onboarding, import VS Code or Cursor settings for seamless transition.
- **Keybindings:** Choose VS Code, Vim, or custom keybindings.
- **Terminal:** Integrated terminal supports standard shell commands; AI can suggest and execute commands.
- **Third-party Tools:** Use extensions or configure external tools via settings (e.g., Git integration, linters).
- **API/Webhooks:** (If available) Configure outgoing webhooks for CI/CD or notifications.

---

## 7. Configuration

- **Settings Panel:** Access via the gear icon or `Ctrl+,`.
- **Authentication:** Sign in with your Windsurf account to unlock AI features and manage credits.
- **Model Selection:** Choose default AI model (SWE-1 Lite, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).
- **Theme & Appearance:** Select editor theme, font, and layout.
- **Environment Variables:** Configure per-project or global environment variables for builds and tests.
- **Proxy/Network:** Set proxy settings if behind a firewall.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **AI Not Responding:**  
  - Check internet connection.
  - Ensure you are signed in and have available credits.
- **Installation Fails (Linux):**  
  - Verify repository and key setup.
  - Run `sudo apt-get update` before installing.
- **Model Rate Limits:**  
  - Wait for reset or switch to SWE-1 Lite if premium credits are exhausted.
- **Code Generation Errors:**  
  - Refine your prompt for clarity.
  - Break large tasks into smaller steps[2].

---

## 9. Best Practices

- **Prompt Engineering:** Be specific and detailed in instructions for best results.
- **Iterative Development:** Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable prompts.
- **Review Generated Code:** Always review and test AI-generated code before deploying.
- **Leverage Multi-file Edits:** Use Cascade for refactoring or updating patterns across files.
