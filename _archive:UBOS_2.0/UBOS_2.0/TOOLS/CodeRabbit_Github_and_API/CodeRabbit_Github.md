**CodeRabbit GitHub** is an AI-powered code review tool that integrates directly with GitHub to automate, accelerate, and enhance the code review process. Below is comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of using CodeRabbit in your development workflow.

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

**CodeRabbit** automates code reviews for GitHub repositories using advanced AI models and static analysis tools. Its main use cases include:

- **Automated pull request reviews**: Instantly analyzes code changes and provides actionable feedback as PR comments.
- **Security and quality checks**: Integrates 40+ linters and security scanners for comprehensive code analysis.
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Offers improvement recommendations based on your repository’s coding patterns and history.
- **Interactive review**: Enables chat-based Q&A about code changes directly in PRs.
- **Documentation and test generation**: Automatically generates docstrings and unit tests for new or modified code[1][2][3][5].

---

## 2. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **GitHub account** with admin access to the target repository or organization.
- **Supported platforms**: GitHub.com (cloud), GitHub Enterprise (see docs for latest support).

### Quickstart

1. **Visit the CodeRabbit website**: Go to [coderabbit.ai](https://coderabbit.ai).
2. **Sign in with GitHub**: Click “Sign in with GitHub” and authorize CodeRabbit to access your repositories.
3. **Install the GitHub App**:
   - Select the repositories or organizations where you want CodeRabbit to operate.
   - Grant the required permissions (read/write access to code and pull requests).
4. **Configure repository settings** (optional):
   - Use the CodeRabbit web dashboard to adjust review preferences, enable/disable features, or set up path-based rules[1][2].

### Local Development (for docs or self-hosted scenarios)

If contributing to CodeRabbit docs or running locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coderabbitai/coderabbit-docs.git
cd coderabbit-docs
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
This starts a local server for documentation development[3].

## 3. Core Features

- **AI-generated summaries**: Concise explanations of what changed and why.
- **File-by-file walkthroughs**: Detailed breakdowns of each file’s modifications.
- **Visual diagrams**: Flow diagrams illustrating architectural impact.
- **Interactive chat**: Ask questions about code changes in natural language.
- **Code graph analysis**: Maps dependencies and downstream effects.
- **Automated code suggestions**: Inline, committable fixes for detected issues.
- **Security & quality scanning**: Runs 40+ linters and security tools.
- **Unit test and docstring generation**: One-click creation of tests and documentation.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Analyzes every commit, not just the initial PR[1][2][5].

## 4. Usage Examples

### Common PR Commands (as PR comments)

- **Request a review of new changes**:
  ```
  @coderabbitai review
  ```
- **Request a full review** (for major changes):
  ```
  @coderabbitai full review
  ```
- **Generate a summary**:
  ```
  @coderabbitai summary
  ```
- **Pause/resume reviews**:
  ```
  @coderabbitai pause
  @coderabbitai resume
  ```
- **Generate docstrings**:
  ```
  @coderabbitai generate docstrings
  ```
- **Export configuration**:
  ```
  @coderabbitai configuration
  ```
These commands are entered as comments in the pull request thread[4].

## 6. Integration Guide

- **GitHub Integration**: CodeRabbit is installed as a GitHub App and operates natively within GitHub pull requests.
- **Other Platforms**: Support for GitLab and Bitbucket is in progress; check the docs for updates.
- **CI/CD Integration**: CodeRabbit can be configured to trigger reviews as part of your CI pipeline by using PR events.
- **Third-party tools**: Integrate with Slack or email for notifications via GitHub’s native notification system or webhooks[2].

---

## 7. Configuration

- **Web Dashboard**: Adjust review depth, focus areas (e.g., security, style), and notification preferences.
- **Repository-level config files**: Place a `.coderabbit.yml` in your repo to set:
  - Paths to include/exclude
  - Custom rules or linter settings
  - Review triggers (e.g., only on PR open, or on every commit)
- **Authentication**: OAuth via GitHub; permissions are managed through the GitHub App interface.
- **Environment variables** (for self-hosted or advanced use):
  - `CODERABBIT_API_KEY`
  - `CODERABBIT_REPO_CONFIG`
  - See docs for full list[2][4].

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

- **CodeRabbit not commenting on PRs**:
  - Ensure the GitHub App is installed and has access to the repository.
  - Check that PR events (open, update) are enabled in GitHub settings.
- **Missing or incomplete reviews**:
  - Confirm that the `.coderabbit.yml` config is valid (use the YAML validator).
  - Large PRs may be rate-limited; try splitting into smaller changes.
- **Authentication errors**:
  - Re-authenticate via the CodeRabbit dashboard.
  - Verify GitHub permissions.
- **Unexpected review behavior**:
  - Use `@coderabbitai configuration` to export and inspect current settings.
  - Contact support via the CodeRabbit dashboard or community forums[4].

---

## 9. Best Practices

- **Start with incremental reviews**: Use `@coderabbitai review` for focused feedback on new changes.
- **Request full reviews for major changes**: Use `@coderabbitai full review` after large refactors.
- **Pause reviews during active development**: Use `@coderabbitai pause` to avoid noise, then `@coderabbitai resume` when ready.
- **Leverage learning**: Give feedback to CodeRabbit in PR comments (e.g., style preferences); it will adapt future reviews.
- **Automate documentation**: Use `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to keep code well-documented.
- **Validate configuration**: Use the YAML validator before committing config changes[4].
