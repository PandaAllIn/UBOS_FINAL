<think>
The user is asking for comprehensive documentation for GitHub Copilot, and they've provided specific sections they want covered. Looking at the search results, I have good information about GitHub Copilot from official GitHub documentation and VS Code documentation.

Let me organize this into the requested structure:

1. Overview & Purpose - I have good info from search results 1 and 3
2. Installation & Setup - Search result 4 has some setup info for VS Code
3. Core Features - Search results 1 and 2 have detailed feature lists
4. Usage Examples - Search result 4 has some examples
5. API Reference - Not much specific API info in the search results
6. Integration Guide - Some info about IDE integrations
7. Configuration - Limited info in search results
8. Troubleshooting - Not much specific troubleshooting info
9. Best Practices - Search result 5 mentions best practices but doesn't detail them
10. Resources - I can compile from the search results

I need to be comprehensive and detailed as requested, using the information from search results while filling in gaps with my knowledge where appropriate. I should cite the search results appropriately and follow the formatting guidelines.

Since this is a technical documentation task, I should use proper markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and make it visually appealing and readable.

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub that helps developers write code faster and with less effort, allowing them to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration[1]. This comprehensive documentation covers everything you need to know about using GitHub Copilot effectively in your development workflow.

## Overview & Purpose

GitHub Copilot serves as your AI pair programmer, working alongside you directly in your editor to suggest whole lines or entire functions as you code[3]. The tool has been proven to increase developer productivity and accelerate the pace of software development[1]. 

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Code Generation**: Autocomplete-style suggestions for functions, classes, and entire code blocks
- **Code Explanation**: Understanding complex code through natural language explanations  
- **Debugging Assistance**: Identifying and fixing bugs in your codebase
- **Test Generation**: Creating unit tests and test cases automatically
- **Documentation**: Generating code comments and documentation
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure and organization
- **Learning**: Educational support for new programming languages and frameworks

## Installation & Setup

### **Step 1: Account Setup**
GitHub Copilot requires a subscription. You can start with the Copilot Free plan or choose from paid tiers for additional features[4].

### **Step 2: IDE Installation**

**Visual Studio Code:**
1. Hover over the Copilot icon in the Status Bar
2. Select **Set up Copilot**
3. Choose a sign-in method and follow the prompts
4. If you don't have a subscription, you'll be automatically signed up for Copilot Free[4]

**Supported IDEs:**
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio  
- JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.)
- Azure Data Studio
- Xcode
- Vim/Neovim
- Eclipse[2]

**Other Platforms:**
- GitHub Mobile (chat interface)
- Windows Terminal Canary (Terminal Chat interface)
- GitHub CLI (command line access)
- GitHub website[1]

## Core Features

### **Code Completion**
Autocomplete-style suggestions that appear as you type in supported IDEs. The system analyzes your code context and provides relevant completions[2].

### **Next Edit Suggestions**
Advanced feature in VS Code that predicts the location of your next edit and suggests appropriate completions[2].

### **Copilot Chat**
Interactive chat interface available across multiple platforms that lets you ask coding-related questions. You can access Copilot Chat on:
- GitHub website
- GitHub Mobile
- Supported IDEs
- Windows Terminal[2]

### **Copilot Coding Agent (Public Preview)**
An autonomous AI agent that can make code changes independently. You can assign GitHub issues to Copilot, and the agent will:
- Plan and implement required changes
- Create pull requests for review
- Work on code changes across multiple files[2]

### **Agent Mode**
Helps make sweeping changes by analyzing code, proposing edits, running tests, and validating results across multiple files[3].

### **Model Selection**
Swap between different AI models including OpenAI GPT-5, Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for different types of coding tasks[3].

### **Copilot Spaces**
Organize and share task-specific context to get more relevant answers from Copilot[1].

### **Advanced Features (Enterprise)**
- Knowledge bases for documentation context
- Code review capabilities
- Pull request description generation[1]

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Code Completion**

```javascript
// Create a new JavaScript file and start typing
function factorial(
// Copilot will suggest the complete function implementation
```

### **Agent Mode Usage**
1. Open the Chat view (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux, `⌃⌘I` on Mac)
2. Select **Agent** from the chat mode dropdown
3. Request complex tasks like: "Create a basic node.js web app for sharing recipes. Make it look modern and responsive."

The agent will independently generate code across multiple files and install dependencies[4].

### **Inline Chat**
1. Select code in your editor
2. Press `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘I` (Mac) to open inline chat
3. Ask for modifications: "Refactor this code to use async/await"
4. Review and accept suggested changes[4]

### **Chat Examples**
```
User: "Explain this regular expression"
User: "Generate unit tests for this function"
User: "How can I optimize this database query?"
User: "Convert this callback to a Promise"
```

## API Reference

### **GitHub CLI Integration**
Access Copilot through the GitHub CLI for command-line assistance[1].

### **Skills with Copilot Chat**
Users can utilize specialized skills within Copilot Chat for enhanced functionality[2].

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
GitHub Copilot integrates with MCP servers to access data from repositories and external resources[3].

## Integration Guide

### **IDE Integrations**
GitHub Copilot integrates seamlessly with major development environments:

**VS Code Integration:**
- Inline suggestions appear as ghost text
- Chat panel for interactive assistance
- Status bar integration for quick access[4]

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
When using the coding agent, GitHub Copilot can run code using GitHub Actions to deliver ready-to-review pull requests[3].

### **Repository Integration**
Copilot can access and understand your repository context, working like an onboarded team member from day one[3].

## Configuration

### **Authentication Setup**
Configure authentication through your IDE's Copilot extension settings after initial setup[4].

### **Content Exclusion**
Organizations can configure content exclusion policies to control what code Copilot can access[5].

### **Model Selection Settings**
Configure which AI models are available for different types of tasks[5].

### **Rate Limits**
Be aware of rate limits that may apply to your Copilot usage[5].

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Setup Issues**
- Ensure you have an active Copilot subscription
- Verify IDE extension is properly installed and updated
- Check network settings if Copilot isn't responding[5]

### **Performance Optimization**
- Keep your IDE and Copilot extension updated
- Ensure stable internet connection for best performance
- Consider model selection based on task complexity

## Best Practices

### **Effective Prompting**
- Be specific and clear in your requests
- Provide context about your project and requirements
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### **Code Review**
- Always review Copilot's suggestions before accepting
- Test generated code thoroughly
- Understand the logic behind suggestions
