Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line interface tool that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your terminal, enabling developers to turn ideas into working code faster than ever before[1]. This agentic coding tool leverages Anthropic's latest models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus, to provide intelligent code generation, debugging, and project navigation capabilities[3].

## Overview & Purpose

Claude Code functions as an AI pair programmer that lives in your terminal, designed to streamline the entire software development workflow[1]. The tool excels at **building features from natural language descriptions**, where developers can describe what they want to build in plain English, and Claude will create a plan, write the code, and ensure it works properly[1].

**Key Use Cases:**
- **Feature Development**: Convert plain English descriptions into fully functional code implementations
- **Debugging and Issue Resolution**: Analyze codebases, identify problems, and implement fixes based on bug descriptions or error messages
- **Codebase Navigation**: Provide intelligent answers about project structure and code organization while maintaining awareness of the entire project
- **Task Automation**: Handle tedious tasks like fixing lint issues, resolving merge conflicts, and generating release notes[1]

The tool integrates with external data sources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling access to services like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack for enhanced context and functionality[1].

## Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18 or newer
- A Claude.ai account (recommended) or Anthropic Console account[1]

**Basic Installation:**

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-awesome-project

# Start Claude Code
claude

# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

**Platform-Specific Setup:**

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Verify installation
which claude
claude --version
```

**Windows:**
Anthropic provides full Windows support for Claude Code[2]. Use these commands to locate your installation:

```cmd
# Command Prompt
where claude

# PowerShell
Get-Command claude
```

**Authentication Setup:**
```bash
# Check authentication status
claude auth status

# Switch accounts if needed
claude login

# Sign out
claude logout
```

## Core Features

**Interactive Coding Assistant**
Claude Code operates in multiple chat modes, providing conversational interaction for development tasks[3]. The tool maintains project memory through documentation files and can deploy specialized sub-agents for specific tasks.

**Built-in Development Workflows**
The system supports common development patterns including refactoring, testing, documentation updates, and code reviews through natural language commands[5].

**Project Context Management**
Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, enabling intelligent suggestions and modifications that consider the broader codebase context[1].

**Model Context Protocol Integration**
The tool connects to external data sources and services through MCP servers, extending its capabilities beyond local file systems[4].

## Usage Examples

**Starting Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# Basic interactive session
claude

# Continue previous conversation
claude -c

# Resume a specific conversation
claude -r
```

**One-Time Task Execution:**
```bash
# Execute a single task
claude "fix the build error"

# Quick query without starting session
claude -p "explain this function"
```

**Common Development Tasks:**
```bash
# Feature development
> build a user authentication system with JWT tokens

# Code refactoring
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks

# Testing
> write unit tests for the calculator functions

# Documentation
> update the README with installation instructions

# Code review
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

**Git Integration:**
```bash
# Create intelligent commit messages
claude commit
```

## Integration Guide

**Cline Integration**
Claude Code integrates with Cline, allowing developers to use their existing Claude subscription without additional API costs[2]. This integration is particularly beneficial for Claude Max or Pro subscribers.

**Setup Process:**
1. Install and authenticate Claude Code following the official setup guide
2. Open Cline settings (⚙️ icon)
3. Select "Claude Code" from the API Provider dropdown
4. Set the path to your Claude CLI executable (typically `claude` if in PATH)[2]

**Continuous Integration**
Claude Code can be automated in CI environments to handle tasks like fixing lint issues, resolving merge conflicts, and generating release notes automatically[1].

**Development Environment Integration**
The tool supports key bindings for enhanced terminal interaction, including Shift+Enter support for iTerm2 and VSCode environments[4].

## Configuration

**Project Initialization**
```bash
# Initialize project with CLAUDE.md guide
claude
> /init
```

**Model Selection**
```bash
# Change AI model
> /model
```

**Permission Management**
```bash
# View current permissions
> /permissions

# Update permissions as needed
```

**Memory Management**
```bash
# Edit project memory files
> /memory
```

**MCP Server Configuration**
```bash
# Manage MCP connections and OAuth
> /mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication Issues**
- Verify login status: `claude auth status`
- Ensure you're using the correct subscription account
- Try re-authenticating: `claude login`[2]

**Path Configuration Problems**
- Verify Claude CLI installation: `claude --version`
- Check executable path using platform-specific commands
- Update PATH environment variable if necessary[2]

**Installation Health Check**
```bash
# Run diagnostic check
claude
> /doctor
```

**Performance Issues**
- Use `/compact` command to optimize conversation history
- Clear conversation history with `/clear` when needed
- Monitor token usage with `/cost` command[4]

## Best Practices

**Effective Communication Patterns**
Treat Claude Code as a helpful colleague rather than a simple tool. Describe your objectives clearly and provide context about what you're trying to achieve[5].

**Project Organization**
- Initialize projects with `/init` to establish proper documentation structure
- Use `/memory` to maintain project-specific context and guidelines
- Leverage `/add-dir` to include relevant directories in the working context[4]

**Workflow Optimization**
- Use one-time commands for quick queries to avoid unnecessary conversation overhead
- Employ `/compact` regularly to maintain conversation efficiency
- Utilize specialized agents for recurring specialized tasks[3]

**Context Management**
- Maintain clear project documentation through CLAUDE.md files
- Use descriptive commit messages with `claude commit`
- Regularly review and update permissions to ensure appropriate access levels[4]
