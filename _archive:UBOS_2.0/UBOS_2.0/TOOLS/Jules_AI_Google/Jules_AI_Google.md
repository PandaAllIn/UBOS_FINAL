**Jules AI (Google Jules) is Google’s autonomous, agentic coding assistant designed to automate software development tasks such as bug fixing, test writing, documentation, and feature implementation by deeply understanding your codebase and integrating directly with GitHub.** Below is comprehensive documentation for developers.

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

**Jules AI** is an asynchronous coding agent powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, built to:
- **Autonomously analyze and modify entire codebases** (not just single files)[2][3].
- **Automate repetitive development tasks**: writing/fixing tests, updating dependencies, generating documentation, and building new features[1][2][3].
- **Integrate with GitHub** for seamless workflow, operating directly on your repositories[2][3][4].
- **Operate asynchronously**: You can assign tasks and continue working while Jules processes them in the background[2][4].

**Main use cases:**
- Large-scale code refactoring
- Automated bug fixing
- Test generation
- Documentation improvement
- Dependency management
- Feature prototyping

## 2. Installation & Setup

### Web-based Setup (Recommended)

1. **Visit** [jules.google.com][4].
2. **Sign in** with your Google account.
3. **Accept the privacy notice** (one-time).
4. **Connect your GitHub account**:
   - Click “Connect to GitHub account.”
   - Complete the OAuth login flow.
   - Select all or specific repositories for Jules access.
   - You’ll be redirected back to Jules; refresh if needed[4].
5. **Select a repository** from the repo selector.
6. **Start prompting tasks** using the input box[4].

### Platform Support

- **Web**: Fully supported via browser.
- **No local installation** required; all operations run in a secure Google Cloud VM[2].
- **CLI/IDE Plugins**: Not officially available as of September 2025; all usage is through the web interface[4].

---

## 3. Core Features

- **Deep codebase understanding**: Analyzes entire repositories, not just files[2][3].
- **Autonomous task execution**: Fixes bugs, writes tests, updates dependencies, and builds features asynchronously[2][3][4].
- **GitHub integration**: Directly connects to your repositories for seamless workflow[2][3][4].
- **Plan and reasoning visibility**: Presents its plan and reasoning before making changes; you can review and modify[2].
- **Audio changelogs**: Generates audio summaries of recent commits for contextual project updates[2].
- **Parallel execution**: Handles multiple tasks concurrently in isolated cloud VMs[2].
- **User steerability**: You can intervene and adjust Jules’ plan at any stage[2].
- **Privacy by default**: Does not train on your private code; all data is isolated in the execution environment[2].

## 4. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Fix a Bug

1. Select your repository.
2. In the prompt box, enter:  
   `"Fix the bug in the user authentication flow that causes login failures on invalid tokens."`
3. Review Jules’ plan and reasoning.
4. Approve or modify the plan.
5. Jules executes the fix and presents a diff for review[2][4].

### Example 2: Add Unit Tests

Prompt:  
`"Write comprehensive unit tests for the payment processing module."`

Jules will:
- Analyze the module
- Generate test files
- Present the changes for your approval[2][3][4]

### Example 3: Update Dependencies

Prompt:  
`"Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions and resolve any breaking changes."`

Jules will:
- Bump dependency versions
- Refactor code as needed
- Show a summary and diff[2][3]

## 5. API Reference

**Jules is primarily accessed via the web interface.**  
As of September 2025, there is no public REST API or CLI, but the following actions are available through the UI:

| Action                | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Connect GitHub        | Authorize and select repositories                |
| Prompt Task           | Enter natural language instructions              |
| Review Plan           | Inspect and modify Jules’ proposed plan          |
| Approve/Reject Plan   | Control execution of code changes                |
| View Diff             | See code changes before merging                  |
| Audio Changelog       | Listen to summaries of recent commits            |
| Manage Tasks          | Track and manage all active and completed tasks  |

## 6. Integration Guide

- **GitHub**: Native integration; connect your account and select repos during setup[2][3][4].
- **Google Cloud**: All code execution occurs in secure, ephemeral Google Cloud VMs[2].
- **CI/CD**: Use Jules to automate code improvements before merging to main branches; manual review is always required[2][3].
- **Other Tools**: No direct integration with third-party IDEs or CI/CD tools as of this release.

---

## 7. Configuration

- **Authentication**: Google account (OAuth) and GitHub account (OAuth)[4].
- **Repository Selection**: Choose which repos Jules can access; can be changed anytime[4].
- **Environment**: All tasks run in isolated Google Cloud VMs; no local setup required[2].
- **Privacy**: Jules does not train on your code; all data is isolated and private by default[2].
- **Usage Limits**: Vary by subscription tier (Intro, Pro, Ultra); see your account dashboard for specifics[1].

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Issue                                   | Solution                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cannot connect GitHub                    | Ensure you’re logged into the correct GitHub account; retry OAuth flow   |
| Repo not appearing after connection      | Refresh the page; check repo permissions in GitHub settings              |
| Task stuck or not completing             | Check your usage limits; try restarting the task                         |
| Changes not visible                      | Review the diff panel; ensure you’ve selected the correct branch         |
| Audio changelog not playing              | Ensure browser audio permissions are enabled                             |
| Authentication errors                    | Log out and back in; clear browser cache                                 |

## 9. Best Practices

- **Prompt clearly**: Use specific, actionable instructions for best results.
- **Review all changes**: Always inspect Jules’ plan and code diff before merging.
- **Iterate with feedback**: Provide feedback to refine Jules’ outputs.
- **Limit scope per task**: For complex changes, break work into smaller prompts.
- **Maintain manual control**: Jules never auto-merges; you retain final approval[3].
