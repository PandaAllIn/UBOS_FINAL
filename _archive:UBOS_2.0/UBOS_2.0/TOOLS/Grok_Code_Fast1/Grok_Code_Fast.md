**Grok Code Fast** is a high-speed, economical AI-powered coding assistant developed by xAI, designed to accelerate code generation, debugging, and analysis with a focus on agentic workflows and large codebases. It supports interactive coding tasks such as building websites, animations, data dashboards, and AI-powered applications by providing fast, coherent, and context-rich code outputs with visible reasoning traces[1][2][3].

---

### 1. Overview & Purpose

- **What it does:** Grok Code Fast generates, analyzes, and interacts with code quickly and efficiently. It supports multi-step coding workflows, including running shell commands, editing files, and autonomous operations beyond simple code generation.
- **Main use cases:** 
  - Generating boilerplate code and unit tests
  - Writing documentation and simple refactoring
  - Handling large codebases with a 256K token context window
  - Supporting interactive development for websites, games, dashboards, and AI apps
  - Integration into CI/CD pipelines and developer tools for automation[1][2][3][4].

### 2. Installation & Setup

- **API & SDK installation (Python example):**
  1. Install the xAI SDK via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install xai-sdk
     ```
  2. Export your API key as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export XAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
  3. Import and instantiate the client in your Python code:
     ```python
     import xai_sdk
     client = xai_sdk.Client()
     ```
- **Platform support:** The SDK is compatible with Python environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux. CLI and IDE integrations (e.g., GitHub Copilot in VS Code) are also available as opt-in features[3][5][6].

---

### 3. Core Features

- **Speed & Efficiency:** Approximately 92 tokens/second throughput with low latency.
- **Large Context Window:** Supports up to 256,000 tokens for handling large files and repositories.
- **MoE Architecture:** 314 billion parameters with Mixture-of-Experts design for specialized routing, balancing speed and capability.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Supports function/tool calls, shell command execution, multi-step autonomous coding tasks.
- **Visible Reasoning Traces:** Outputs reasoning steps inline to improve transparency and steerability.
- **Cost-effective Pricing:** Low token costs ($0.20/M input, $1.50/M output, $0.02/M cached tokens).
- **High API Limits:** Up to ~480 requests/minute and ~2 million tokens/minute for high-throughput use cases[1][2][3].

### 4. Usage Examples

**Python example: Generate Fibonacci function using async API call**

```python
import asyncio
import xai_sdk

async def main():
    client = xai_sdk.Client()
    prompt = "Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers."
    async for token in client.sampler.sample(prompt, max_len=100, model="grok-code-fast-1"):
        print(token.token_str, end="")

asyncio.run(main())
```

This streams tokens with reasoning traces, showing step-by-step code generation[5].

### 5. API Reference

- **Model name:** `"grok-code-fast-1"`
- **Key methods:**
  - `client.sampler.sample(prompt, max_len, model)` â€” streams generated tokens asynchronously.
  - Supports parameters like `temperature` (creativity), `top_p` (diversity), and caching options.
- **Authentication:** API key via environment variable `XAI_API_KEY`.
- **Rate limits:** ~480 requests/minute, ~2M tokens/minute.
- **Function/tool calls:** Supports invoking shell commands and multi-step workflows programmatically[2][3][5].

---

### 6. Integration Guide

- **IDE Integration:** Available as an opt-in model in GitHub Copilot for VS Code.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Use API for automated code generation, testing, and deployment workflows.
- **SDK Integration:** Use xAI SDK in Python or other supported languages for embedding Grok Code Fast into internal developer tools.
- **Agentic workflows:** Automate multi-step coding tasks by chaining function calls and shell commands within the model's reasoning framework[1][2][3].

---

### 7. Configuration

- **API Key:** Required for authentication, set as environment variable `XAI_API_KEY`.
- **Model selection:** Specify `"grok-code-fast-1"` in API calls.
- **Parameters:** Adjust `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_len` for output control.
- **Environment:** Compatible with Python 3.x environments; network access required for API calls.
- **Optional:** Cache prompts to reduce costs on repeated calls[
