<think>
The user is asking for comprehensive documentation about "Local Universal LLM" which they describe as "Self-hosted LLM solutions for UBOS". However, looking at the search results, I don't see any specific information about a tool called "Local Universal LLM" that's specifically for UBOS.

From the search results, I can see:
1. Information about local LLMs in general and how to use them with LangChain
2. Information about UBOS as a low-code platform
3. Information about Elastic Security's LLM access
4. Some video content about local LLM inference
5. A GitHub repo about awesome local LLMs
6. Information about MLC LLM

The search results don't contain specific information about a tool called "Local Universal LLM" for UBOS. From search result [2], I can see that UBOS is "a powerful low-code platform designed to facilitate the rapid development and deployment of web applications" and mentions that you can "easily create a chatbot that provides intelligent responses to customer inquiries", but there's no specific mention of "Local Universal LLM" as a distinct tool.

Since the search results don't contain information about this specific tool, I should explain that the information is not available in the search results. However, I can provide some general guidance about local LLM solutions based on what is available in the search results, particularly around tools like Ollama and how they might integrate with platforms like UBOS.

But the user is asking for very specific documentation about "Local Universal LLM" for UBOS, and this specific tool doesn't appear to exist in the search results. I should be honest about this limitation.

Based on the provided search results, I cannot find specific information about a tool called "Local Universal LLM" designed specifically for UBOS self-hosted LLM solutions. The search results do not contain documentation or references to this particular tool.

However, I can provide information about local LLM solutions that could potentially be integrated with UBOS platform based on the available search results:

## Available Local LLM Solutions

**UBOS Platform Context**
UBOS is a powerful low-code platform designed to facilitate rapid development and deployment of web applications[2]. The platform supports building AI-powered solutions, including chatbots that provide intelligent responses to customer inquiries, and can integrate with multiple channels such as email, social media, and SMS[2].

**Local LLM Integration Options**

### Ollama Integration
One of the most practical approaches for local LLM deployment involves using Ollama, which is an open-source tool that runs LLMs directly on local machines in isolated environments[1]. Here's how it works:

```bash
# Download and install Ollama
$ ollama pull llama3.2:1b

# Install required packages
$ pip install langchain
$ pip install -qU langchain-ollama
```

```python
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama

llm = ChatOllama(
    model="llama3.2:1b",
)

messages = [
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French. Translate the user sentence."),
    ("human", "I love programming."),
]

ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
print(ai_msg.content)
```

### MLC LLM Solution
Another option is MLC LLM, which is described as "a machine learning compiler and high-performance deployment engine for large language models" with a mission "to enable everyone to develop, optimize, and deploy AI models natively"[6].

## Alternative Approaches

For organizations looking to implement local LLM solutions with platforms like UBOS, consider:

- **LM Studio**: Can be connected for custom LLM deployment and management[3]
- **Third-party connectors**: Various preconfigured connectors are available for different LLM providers[3]
- **Open-source inference tools**: Multiple categories exist including LLM inference backend engines, front-end UIs, and all-in-one desktop applications[5]

If you're specifically looking for "Local Universal LLM" for UBOS, I recommend checking the official UBOS documentation or community resources, as this specific tool does not appear in the current search results. The platform's low-code nature suggests that LLM integration might be available through their template system or custom integrations[2].
