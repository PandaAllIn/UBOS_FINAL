Cursor is an AI-powered code editor designed to revolutionize software development by integrating advanced artificial intelligence directly into the coding workflow[2]. Built as an intelligent alternative to traditional code editors, Cursor enables developers to write, modify, and understand code using natural language instructions, making programming more intuitive and significantly faster[2].

## Overview & Purpose

Cursor serves as a comprehensive development environment that combines the familiarity of VS Code with cutting-edge AI capabilities. The editor allows developers to **write code using instructions**, update entire classes or functions with simple prompts, and build software at unprecedented speed[2]. The tool is **trusted by engineers at leading companies** and has achieved remarkable product-market fit, with many developers calling it their new favorite development tool[2].

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Rapid Code Generation**: Create entire functions, classes, or modules through natural language descriptions
- **Code Modification**: Update existing codebases with AI-assisted refactoring and enhancement
- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Advanced autocomplete that predicts and suggests multi-line code blocks
- **Codebase Understanding**: Get instant answers about your codebase structure and functionality
- **Documentation Integration**: Reference files, documentation, and Git history directly within the editor

## Installation & Setup

### **Download and Installation**

Getting started with Cursor is straightforward and takes just minutes[4]:

1. **Download**: Navigate to cursor.com and click the "Download" button[4]
2. **Installation**: Run the installer once the download completes[4]  
3. **Launch**: Open Cursor when installation finishes[4]

For specific versions or alternative installation methods, visit cursor.com/downloads to find options for all supported platforms[4].

### **First-Time Setup**

When you launch Cursor for the first time, you'll be guided through a quick setup process[4]:

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Choose shortcuts that feel familiar to your workflow[4]
- **Theme Selection**: Pick a visual theme that suits your preferences[4]  
- **Terminal Configuration**: Set up your terminal preferences for integrated development[4]

You can revisit the setup wizard anytime by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and searching for "Cursor: Start Onboarding"[4].

### **Migration from Other Editors**

**VS Code Migration**: Import all your VS Code settings, extensions, themes, and keybindings in one click[2][4].

**Other Editors**: Migration guides are available for JetBrains, Eclipse, Neovim, and Sublime Text[4].

## Core Features

### **Composer - AI Coding Assistant**

Composer serves as your intelligent coding partner integrated directly into the editor[1]. This powerful feature enables:

- **Agent Mode**: Proactive coding assistance that understands your entire codebase[1]
- **Smart Context**: Automatic context retrieval using @Recommended and other context tools[1]  
- **Code Generation**: AI-powered code creation and modification without leaving your workflow[1]

### **Cursor Tab - Intelligent Code Completion**

Tab functionality provides a more advanced alternative to GitHub Copilot with enhanced capabilities[1]:

- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware code completions that understand recent changes[1]
- **Multi-line Editing**: Edit multiple lines simultaneously with intelligent diff suggestions[1]
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing keyboard shortcuts and workflow patterns[1]

### **Advanced Context Management**

Cursor's comprehensive context system uses @ symbols for precise AI interaction control[1]:

- **@Files & @Folders**: Reference entire files or directories for comprehensive context[1]
- **@Code & @Docs**: Include specific code snippets and documentation in queries[1]
- **@Git & @Web**: Access Git history and web resources directly within your workflow[1]

### **Agent Mode Capabilities**

Agent represents Cursor's autonomous assistant capable of complex coding tasks[7]:

- **Independent Task Completion**: Handles multi-step coding processes autonomously[7]
- **Terminal Integration**: Executes commands, monitors output, and manages processes[7]
- **Code Integration**: Applies AI-suggested code blocks efficiently while maintaining precision[7]
- **Change Management**: Automatic snapshots track changes with restoration capabilities[7]

## Usage Examples

### **Basic AI Code Generation**

```python
# Simply describe what you want in natural language
# Example prompt: "Create a Python function that calculates compound interest"

def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compound_frequency):
    """
    Calculate compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
    
    Args:
        principal: Initial investment amount
        rate: Annual interest rate (as decimal)
        time: Investment period in years
        compound_frequency: Number of times interest compounds per year
    
    Returns:
        Final amount after compound interest
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compound_frequency) ** (compound_frequency * time)
    return amount
```

### **Context-Aware Code Modification**

Use the @ symbol system to provide specific context:

```bash
# Example: "@files src/utils.py @docs README.md refactor the utility functions to use async/await pattern"
```

### **Multi-Tab Conversations**

Create multiple simultaneous conversations with `Ctrl+T`, each maintaining its own context, history, and model selection[7].

## API Reference

### **CLI Commands**

Access Cursor functionality through the command line interface[6]. Key commands include:

- **Setup Commands**: Configure editor settings and preferences
- **Extension Management**: Install and manage editor extensions  
- **Project Operations**: Initialize and manage development projects

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Essential shortcuts for efficient workflow[4]:

- `Ctrl+Shift+P`: Open command palette
- `Ctrl+T`: Create new conversation tab[7]
- `Alt+Ctrl+'`: Access conversation history[7]
- `Ctrl+Shift+J`: Open settings[4]

## Integration Guide

### **Development Workflow Integration**

Cursor integrates seamlessly into existing development workflows:

- **Version Control**: Direct Git integration for accessing history and managing changes[1]
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Full compatibility with VS Code extensions[2]
- **Terminal Integration**: Built-in terminal support with AI-enhanced command execution[7]

### **Model Selection and Configuration**

Cursor operates as a tool built on top of various AI models, offering flexibility in model selection through a dropdown interface[3]. The editor uses a mix of purpose-built and frontier models to provide intelligent and fast responses[2].

## Configuration

### **Account Setup and Management**

While Cursor works without an account, signing up unlocks full AI features[4]:

1. Sign up during initial setup or later through Settings (`Ctrl+Shift+J`)[4]
2. Manage your account at cursor.com/dashboard[4]
3. Configure AI model preferences and usage limits

### **Privacy and Security**

Cursor offers robust privacy options[2]:

- **Privacy Mode**: Code never stored remotely without explicit consent[2]
- **SOC 2 Certification**: Enterprise-grade security compliance[2]
- **Local Processing**: Option for on-device AI processing when available

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Setup Issues**

- **Installation Problems**: Ensure you're downloading from the official cursor.com website[4]
- **Migration Issues**: Use the built-in migration tools for smooth transition from other editors[4]
- **Extension Compatibility**: Most VS Code extensions work seamlessly; check compatibility for specialized extensions

### **AI Feature Issues**

- **Context Problems**: Ensure proper use of @ symbols for context specification[1]
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on task complexity[3]
- **Performance**: Optimize by managing conversation history and context size

## Best Practices

### **Effective AI Interaction**

- **Clear Prompts**: Write specific, detailed prompts for better AI responses
- **Context Management**: Use @ symbols strategically to provide relevant context[1]
- **Incremental Changes**: Make smaller, focused changes for better results
- **Review Changes**: Always examine AI suggestions before applying them[7]

### **Workflow Optimization**
