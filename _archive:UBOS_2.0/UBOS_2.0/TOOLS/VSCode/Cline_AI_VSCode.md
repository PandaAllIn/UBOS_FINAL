## **Usage Examples**

### **Basic File Creation**

```python
# User request: "Create a Python file named test and add code to print Hello, world"

# Cline generates:
# test.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

The assistant provides a preview of generated content and requests confirmation before saving files to the filesystem[1].

### **Complex Development Tasks**

```javascript
// User request: "Create a React component for user authentication with validation"

// Cline can generate complete components with:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const AuthComponent = () => {
  const [credentials, setCredentials] = useState({ username: '', password: '' });
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Validation logic implemented by Cline
  };
  
  return (
    // Complete JSX structure with form elements
  );
};

export default AuthComponent;
```

### **Terminal Command Execution**

When requesting system operations, Cline displays the intended command and waits for approval:

```bash
# User request: "Install the required dependencies for this React project"
# Cline proposes: npm install
# User approves execution
# Command runs with output monitoring
```
