Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It provides a rich development environment for building modern web, mobile, desktop, and cloud applications with built-in support for debugging, task running, version control, and intelligent code completion[2][4].

## Overview & Purpose

VS Code serves as a **cross-platform development environment** that bridges the gap between simple text editors and full IDEs. Its primary use cases include:

- **Multi-language development** with support for JavaScript, Python, C#, Java, Go, and dozens of other programming languages[2]
- **Web application development** with integrated debugging and testing capabilities
- **Cloud and containerized application development** with remote development support[2]
- **Version control management** with built-in Git integration[2]
- **Extension-based customization** allowing developers to tailor the editor to their specific workflows[2]

The editor is designed to be fast, responsive, and highly customizable while maintaining simplicity in its core interface[4].

## Installation & Setup

### **Windows Installation**
1. Download the Windows installer from the official VS Code website
2. Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard
3. Choose installation options including desktop shortcut and PATH integration
4. Launch VS Code from the Start menu or desktop shortcut

### **macOS Installation**
1. Download the macOS package (`.zip` file) from the official website
2. Extract the archive and drag Visual Studio Code to the Applications folder
3. Open VS Code from the Applications folder or Launchpad
4. Optional: Add VS Code to the dock for quick access

### **Linux Installation**
Multiple installation methods are available:

- **Snap**: Install using `snap install --classic code`
- **Flatpak**: Available through Flathub

### **Initial Configuration**
After installation, complete the setup process:
1. **Choose your theme** (Dark, Light, or High Contrast)
2. **Install essential extensions** based on your development needs[1]
3. **Configure settings** through the Settings UI or `settings.json`
4. **Set up version control** by connecting your Git repositories[2]

## Core Features

### **Intelligent Code Editing**

# Initialize as Git repository
git init

# Open in VS Code
code .
```

### **Working with C# and .NET**
```bash
# Install .NET SDK first, then create new console application
dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp
cd MyConsoleApp

# Open in VS Code with C# extension
code .
```

### **Essential Keyboard Shortcuts**
```
# Command Palette
Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) / Cmd+Shift+P (macOS)

# Quick file open
Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux) / Cmd+P (macOS)

# Toggle terminal
Ctrl+` (backtick)

# Split editor

```

### **Installing Extensions via Command Line**
```bash
# Install popular extensions
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
code --install-extension ms-dotnettools.csharp
```

## API Reference

### **Extension Development API**
VS Code provides comprehensive APIs for extension development[3]:

**Core APIs:**
- `vscode.window` - Window management and UI interactions
- `vscode.workspace` - File system and workspace operations
- `vscode.commands` - Command registration and execution
- `vscode.languages` - Language features and providers

**Common Extension Points:**
```typescript
// Register a command
vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.helloWorld', () => {
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
});

// Create a status bar item
const statusBarItem = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(
    vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, 100
);
```

### **Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Basic VS Code commands
code [file/folder]           # Open file or folder
code -n                      # New window
code -r                      # Reuse window
code --diff file1 file2      # Compare files
code --goto file:line:column # Open at specific location

# Extension management
code --list-extensions       # List installed extensions
code --install-extension     # Install extension
code --uninstall-extension   # Remove extension
```

## Integration Guide

### **Git Integration**
VS Code automatically detects Git repositories and provides:
- **Source Control view** in the Activity Bar for staging and committing changes
- **Git Timeline** for viewing file history
- **Merge conflict resolution** with visual diff tools
- **Branch switching** through the status bar

### **Docker Integration**
```bash
# Install Docker extension
code --install-extension ms-azuretools.vscode-docker
```
- Container development with dev containers
- Dockerfile editing with IntelliSense
- Docker Compose support
- Remote container development

### **Cloud Platform Integration**
- **Azure**: Direct deployment and management of Azure resources
- **AWS**: Integration with AWS services and deployment
- **GitHub**: Built-in GitHub integration for repositories and actions
- **Remote SSH**: Develop on remote machines seamlessly[2]

### **Build System Integration**
Configure tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`:
```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "npm run build",
            "group": "build"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuration

### **User Settings**
Access settings through `File > Preferences > Settings` or `Ctrl+,`:

**Common Settings:**
```json
{
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 12,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Dark+ (default dark)"
}
```

### **Workspace Settings**
Create `.vscode/settings.json` in your project root:
```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "./venv/bin/python",
    "eslint.workingDirectories": ["client", "server"],
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    }
}
```

### **Launch Configuration**
Configure debugging in `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Installation Issues**
- **Permission errors on Linux**: Install using snap or flatpak instead of manual installation
- **PATH not recognized**: Restart terminal or manually add VS Code to system PATH
- **Extensions not loading**: Check extension compatibility with VS Code version

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow startup**: Disable unnecessary extensions or use extension profiles
- **High memory usage**: Check for memory-intensive extensions and consider alternatives
- **Sluggish editor**: Reduce file watchers and disable unused language services

### **Extension Problems**
- **Extension conflicts**: Use extension bisect to identify problematic extensions
- **API deprecated warnings**: Update extensions to latest versions
- **Language server crashes**: Restart language servers via Command Palette

### **Debugging Common Issues**
```bash
# Reset to default settings
code --user-data-dir /tmp/vscode-reset

# Run with extensions disabled
code --disable-extensions

# Verbose logging
code --log trace
```

## Best Practices

### **Extension Management**
- **Use extension packs** for related functionality rather than individual extensions
- **Enable extensions per workspace** to avoid conflicts between projects
- **Regular extension audits** to remove unused extensions
- **Use extension profiles** for different development contexts[1]

### **Workspace Organization**
- **Multi-root workspaces** for related projects
- **Consistent folder structure** across projects
- **Version control integration** with proper `.gitignore` files
- **Shared team settings** via workspace configuration

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Exclude unnecessary files** from file watcher using `files.watcherExclude`
- **Limit search scope** with `search.exclude` settings
- **Use TypeScript project references** for large codebases
- **Configure language server settings** appropriately

### **Security Considerations**
- **Workspace trust model** - only enable full functionality for trusted workspaces
- **Extension security** - review extension permissions before installation
- **Remote development** - use secure connections for remote SSH development
- **Sensitive data handling** - configure proper exclusion patterns
