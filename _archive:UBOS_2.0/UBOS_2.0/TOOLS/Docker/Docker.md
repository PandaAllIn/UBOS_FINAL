<think>
The user is asking for comprehensive documentation for Docker, a containerization platform. They want detailed information across 10 specific categories. I need to provide a technical documentation-style answer that covers all these areas using the search results provided.

Looking at the search results, I have good coverage for:
1. Overview & Purpose - covered in multiple search results
2. Core Features - good coverage in search results 1, 2, 3
3. Usage Examples - limited in search results, will need to supplement with general knowledge
4. Architecture information - covered in search result 4
5. Benefits and use cases - covered across multiple results

Areas where search results are limited:
- Installation & setup (not much detail)
- API reference (limited detail)
- Configuration details
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices
- Resources

I'll need to structure this as comprehensive technical documentation while being careful to cite the search results where I use them and supplement with general knowledge where the search results don't provide enough detail.

The user has specified this should be longform and comprehensive, so I should provide detailed sections with practical information.

Docker is a powerful open-source containerization platform that revolutionizes how developers build, deploy, and manage applications by packaging them with their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers[3][6]. This comprehensive documentation provides everything you need to effectively use Docker in your development workflow.

## Overview & Purpose

Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, creating a consistent environment that runs identically across development, testing, and production systems[3]. At its core, Docker uses containers - lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings[2].

**Primary Use Cases:**

Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers, making it ideal for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows[3]. The platform provides fast, consistent delivery of applications where developers can write code locally, share work using Docker containers, push applications to test environments, and deploy to production seamlessly[3].

The containerization approach offers responsive deployment and scaling capabilities, with Docker containers running on developer laptops, physical or virtual machines in data centers, cloud providers, or mixed environments[3]. This portability and lightweight nature enables dynamic workload management, allowing you to scale applications up or down based on business needs in near real-time[3].

## Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Supported operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- Administrative privileges for installation
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- 64-bit processor architecture

**Installation Steps:**

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Set up repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# Verify installation
sudo docker run hello-world
```

**Windows/macOS:**
Download Docker Desktop from the official website and follow the installation wizard. Docker Desktop provides a comprehensive local environment for building and testing containerized applications with integrated development tools[2].

## Core Features

Docker's architecture centers around the **Docker Engine**, a client-server application with three major components: a server daemon process (dockerd), the Docker API for communication, and a command-line interface (CLI)[4].

**Key Capabilities:**

**Containerization and Isolation:** Docker containers provide high-level isolation between applications, preventing them from interacting with or affecting each other[1]. The platform uses Linux kernel features like namespaces and cgroups to isolate the container's view of the operating system and limit resource access[4].

**Image Management:** Docker can automatically build containers based on application source code and track versions of container images, enabling rollbacks to previous versions[6]. Images serve as blueprints for creating containers, containing all necessary components for application execution[1].

**Networking and Volume Management:** Advanced networking capabilities allow containers to communicate securely while volume management enables persistent data storage across container lifecycles[1].

**Security and Scalability:** Built-in security measures protect code throughout the development lifecycle, while the scalable architecture supports both individual developers and large organizations[1][2].

## Usage Examples

**Basic Container Operations:**

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx:latest

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-nginx nginx:latest

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop my-nginx

# Remove a container
docker rm my-nginx

# View container logs
docker logs my-nginx
```

**Building Custom Images:**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile example
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

```bash
# Build image from Dockerfile
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# Run the custom application
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0
```

**Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
  database:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

```bash
# Start multi-container application
docker-compose up -d

# Scale services
docker-compose up -d --scale web=3
```

## API Reference

# GitHub Actions example
name: Docker Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
    - name: Push to registry
      run: docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

**Cloud Platform Integration:**
Docker ensures consistent application performance across environments, whether on-premises Kubernetes or cloud platforms like AWS ECS, Azure ACI, and Google GKE[2].

## Configuration

**Docker Daemon Configuration:**
The Docker daemon can be configured through `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux systems:

```json
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  },
  "registry-mirrors": ["https://mirror.gcr.io"]
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `DOCKER_HOST` - Docker daemon socket location
- `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` - Enable TLS verification
- `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` - Path to TLS certificates

**Resource Limits:**
Configure container resource constraints using runtime options:

```bash
# Limit memory and CPU
docker run -m 512m --cpus="1.5" my-app
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**Permission Denied Errors:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group (Linux)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Logout and login again
```

**Container Connectivity Issues:**
```bash
# Check container networking
docker network ls
docker inspect container_name
```

**Storage Space Problems:**
```bash
# Clean up unused resources
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
