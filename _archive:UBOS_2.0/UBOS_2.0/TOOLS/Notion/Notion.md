- **Collaboration**: Real-time editing, comments, mentions, and shared workspaces.
- **Database Management**: Custom tables, calendars, and lists for structured data.
- **Integration Hub**: Embedding and syncing content from tools like GitHub, Jira, Figma, and more[1][2][3].

**Main use cases**:
- Team and company wikis
- Product and engineering documentation
- Project and sprint management
- Personal productivity (notes, to-dos, knowledge management)
- Centralized file and document management[1][2][3]

## 5. API Reference

**Notion API** (RESTful, JSON-based):  
Base URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/`

### Authentication
- Use Bearer tokens (OAuth 2.0 or integration token).

### Common Endpoints

| Endpoint                | Method | Description                       |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `/databases`            | GET    | List databases                    |
| `/databases/{id}`       | GET    | Retrieve a database               |
| `/pages`                | POST   | Create a page                     |
| `/pages/{id}`           | PATCH  | Update a page                     |
| `/blocks/{id}/children` | GET    | List block children               |
| `/search`               | POST   | Search workspace content          |

**Example: List databases**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     https://api.notion.com/v1/databases
```

## 6. Integration Guide

- **Native Integrations**: Use built-in embeds for Google Drive, Figma, GitHub, Jira, and more. Paste a link or use `/embed`.
- **API Integrations**: Use the Notion API to automate workflows, sync data, or build custom apps.
- **Third-party Tools**: Connect with Zapier, Make (Integromat), or custom scripts for automation.
- **Webhooks**: Notion does not natively support webhooks, but polling via API or using third-party services is common[1][3].

---

## 7. Configuration

### Settings
- Access workspace settings via **Settings & Members**.
- Configure teamspaces, permissions, and integrations.

### Authentication
- For API: Register an integration at [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com).
- Use OAuth 2.0 for user-level access or internal integration tokens for workspace-level access.

### Environment
- No local server setup required.
- For API usage, store tokens securely (e.g., environment variables).

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions**:
- **Sync Delays**: Refresh the page or app; check internet connection.
- **Permission Errors**: Verify page/database sharing settings and integration permissions.
- **API Rate Limits**: Respect documented rate limits; implement retries with backoff.
- **Missing Integrations**: Ensure the integration is added to the correct workspace and has required permissions.
- **Mobile App Issues**: Update the app; clear cache or reinstall if problems persist.

---

## 9. Best Practices

- **Structure**: Use nested pages and databases for logical organization.
- **Templates**: Leverage and customize templates for repeatable processes.
- **Permissions**: Apply least-privilege access; review sharing settings regularly.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a central wiki for onboarding and process documentation.
- **Automation**: Use buttons, reminders, and integrations to reduce manual work.
- **Versioning**: Use version history for critical documents.
