MAKE DASHBOARD INTUITIVE & INTERACTIVE

The dashboard has real data (29 EU funding opportunities, live system status) but the UI doesn't help the user understand what's happening. Fix this by making it much more intuitive and informative.

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

### 1. NO VISUAL FEEDBACK
- Buttons don't show loading states when clicked
- No success/error messages when actions complete
- No progress indicators for long operations
- User can't tell if something is working or broken

### 2. UNCLEAR WHAT BUTTONS DO
- "Scan Now" button - what does it actually scan?
- "Execute Task" - what tasks can I execute?
- Search box - what am I searching through?
- Export buttons - what gets exported?

### 3. MISSING HELPFUL INFORMATION
- No tooltips explaining features
- No help text or examples
- No status indicators showing what's active/working
- No recent activity showing what happened

## SOLUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT:

### A. ADD LOADING STATES & FEEDBACK
```javascript
// When scanning funding:
button.innerHTML = '<span class="spinner"></span> Scanning EU portals...';
// After completion:
showToast('âœ… Found 12 new funding opportunities!', 'success');
```

### B. ADD HELPFUL TOOLTIPS & DESCRIPTIONS
```html
<button title="Scans EU funding portals for new AI/tech opportunities matching EUFM">
  <span>Scan Now</span>
  <small>Last scan: 2 minutes ago, found 29 opportunities</small>
</button>
```

### C. SHOW REAL-TIME ACTIVITY FEED
- "Scanning Horizon Europe portal..."
- "Found 5 AI opportunities in EIC calls"
- "Analyzing opportunity relevance..."
- "âœ… Scan complete - 12 new matches found"

### D. MAKE SEARCH CONTEXTUAL
- Show search suggestions: "Try: AI funding, Horizon Europe, EIC Accelerator"
- Show what you're searching: "Searching 29 opportunities, 21 notes, 8 tools"
- Highlight matches in results

### E. ADD GUIDED ONBOARDING
- First-time user tutorial
- "Try clicking here to scan for funding"
- "This shows your system health"
- "Execute tasks like 'find AI funding for startups'"

### F. IMPROVE TASK EXECUTION
- Show examples: "analyze funding opportunities", "generate proposal outline"
- Show what the system can do
- Live preview of results
- Step-by-step progress

### G. ADD SMART NOTIFICATIONS
- "ðŸš¨ Deadline approaching: EIC Accelerator closes in 5 days"
- "ðŸ’¡ Suggestion: Your project matches 3 high-value opportunities"
- "ðŸ“Š Usage update: 45% of Claude Pro quota used this month"
