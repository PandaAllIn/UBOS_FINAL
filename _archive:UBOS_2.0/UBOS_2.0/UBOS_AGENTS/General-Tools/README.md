# General Tools Documentation Library

**Managed by**: Research & Documentation Agent  
**Purpose**: Centralized, organized documentation for all frameworks, tools, and patterns  
**Organization**: Claude-modular optimized structure for maximum efficiency  

## üìÅ Structure Overview

### `/frameworks/`
Comprehensive documentation for development frameworks
- `claude-modular/` - Token optimization and modular development
- `spec-kit/` - Specification-driven development methodology
- `swarm/` - OpenAI Swarm multi-agent coordination
- Each framework includes:
  - `framework.md` - Overview and architecture
  - `quick-reference.md` - Commands and common tasks  
  - `implementation.md` - Setup and integration guide
  - `examples.md` - Code examples and patterns

### `/tools/`
Tool-specific documentation and usage guides
- `development/` - Development environment tools
- `ai-integrations/` - AI service integrations
- `automation/` - Automation and workflow tools

### `/patterns/`
Reusable patterns and best practices
- `optimization/` - Performance and efficiency patterns
- `architecture/` - System design patterns
- `security/` - Security implementation patterns

### `/quick-access/`
Immediate reference materials
- `commands.md` - Most frequently used commands
- `common-tasks.md` - Step-by-step task guides
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

## üîÑ Organization Principles

### Claude-Modular Integration
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information layered from quick-reference to deep implementation
- **Token Optimization**: Structured for efficient context loading
- **Modular Organization**: Each topic self-contained with cross-references

### Swarm Coordination
- **Handoff Ready**: Documentation structured for agent transitions
- **Context Preservation**: Consistent format for multi-agent workflows
- **Actionable Organization**: Clear next steps and implementation guidance

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Start with `quick-access/` for immediate needs
2. Use framework-specific `quick-reference.md` for commands
3. Refer to `implementation.md` for setup and integration

### For Agents
1. Research & Documentation Agent maintains and updates content
2. Organization Agent handles complex file restructuring
3. Swarm handoffs preserve context through structured metadata

## üìà Continuous Improvement

The Research & Documentation Agent continuously:
- Updates documentation based on latest research
- Optimizes organization based on usage patterns
- Maintains cross-references and consistency
- Prepares content for seamless agent handoffs
