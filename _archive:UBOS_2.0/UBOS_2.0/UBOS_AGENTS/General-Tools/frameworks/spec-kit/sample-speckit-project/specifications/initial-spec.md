    The application should provide a clean, intuitive user interface.
    

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to [define specific functionality]
- As a developer, I want to [define technical requirements]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional requirements are met
- [ ] Performance criteria are satisfied
- [ ] Security requirements are implemented
- [ ] User experience goals are achieved

## Scope and Boundaries
### In Scope
- Core functionality as defined in requirements
- Basic user interface and experience
- Essential integrations

### Out of Scope
- Advanced features not specified
- Third-party integrations beyond requirements
- Performance optimizations beyond basic requirements

## Technical Constraints
- Platform: claude
- Output Format: markdown
- Development Approach: Specification-driven with AI assistance

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate specification
2. Proceed to technical planning phase
3. Break down into implementable tasks
4. Execute with AI-assisted development
