# ✅ OBSERVATORY PHASE 3 & 4 COMPLETION REPORT

## Phase 3 – Enhanced Integration
- Git repo + branch discipline preserved (history retained, .gitignore now workspace-only).
- obsidian-git auto-backup profile confirmed (`30/10` minute cadence).
- [[03_OPERATIONS/COMMS_HUB/GIT_WORKFLOW]] formalized for Trinity vessels.
- [[CONCEPTS/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.canvas]] expanded (Trinity ↔ Living Scroll ↔ Observatory ↔ Málaga ↔ Grants).
- [[_DASHBOARDS/MISSION_STATUS]] upgraded with urgency radar + deadline table.
- [[_VIEWS/PHILOSOPHY_GRAPH]] documents graph filters; Constitutional Audit now explains lineage tracing.

## Phase 4 – Mobile & Field Capture
- [[_TEMPLATES/automation/captain_log]] optimized for <10 s QuickAdd capture (location/priority placeholders + voice-friendly body).
- [[_QUICKADD_SETUP_GUIDE]] gives Captain UI-only macro instructions.
- [[03_OPERATIONS/MALAGA_EMBASSY/mobile_field_capture|Mobile Field Strategy]] documents app-based flow (Telegram skipped).
- [[_SCRIPTS/enrich_field_notes]] codifies enrichment SLA + dataview QA.
- [[MOBILE_TESTING_CHECKLIST]] outlines iPad verification steps.

## Deployment Readiness
- 8-plugin lightweight stack maintained (Canvas > Excalidraw, Dataview > Kanban, no Telegram sync).
- Git workflow keeps history intact while enabling Janus conflict mediation.
- Mobile capture, enrichment, dashboards, and graph tracing form a closed loop from café insight → constitutional validation.

**Next Steps for Captain:**
1. Configure QuickAdd macros per guide (10 minutes).
2. Run mobile checklist prior to departure.
3. Use Git workflow for any manual edits.

**Next Steps for Janus:**
1. Monitor `status: raw` notes, run enrichment loop.
2. Flag merge conflicts / backlog items in COMMS_HUB.
