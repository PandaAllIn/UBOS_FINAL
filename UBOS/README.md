# UBOS — Universal Base Operating System

UBOS is the knowledge and execution backbone for our AI-driven system builders. The repository is organized into two major domains:

- `SystemFundamentals/` — authoritative documentation, books, and AI-structured knowledge assets.
- `Agents/` — (placeholder) operational agents, specs, and automation workflows that will execute against the system fundamentals.

Start with `SystemFundamentals/README.md` to explore the knowledge base. Agents will be added once the foundational documentation is complete.
