  content: '**Knowledge graph orchestration strategies** involve designing, managing,
    and integrating the components and workflows that build, update, and utilize knowledge
    graphs effectively. These strategies focus on how to organize entities (nodes),
    relationships (edges), and schemas (organizing principles or ontologies) to ensure
    the knowledge graph supports accurate, context-aware querying and AI applications.


    Key orchestration strategies include:


    - **Schema and Ontology Management:** Defining and evolving the organizing principles
    or ontologies that structure the graph, which act as conceptual maps or metadata
    layers overlaying the data. This includes dynamically constructing ontologies
    that represent domain concepts, attributes, and relationships to guide data integration
    and querying[1][2][5].


    - **Entity and Relationship Extraction and Disambiguation:** Extracting meaningful
    entities from unstructured data (e.g., natural language) and correctly identifying
    their context-dependent meanings. This often involves context-aware annotation
    and disambiguation to map entities accurately in the graph, crucial for maintaining
    data quality and relevanc'
