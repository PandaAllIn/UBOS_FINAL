The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is actively integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its statistical governance and data collection processes, notably using AI-driven tools like Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) devices to automate census and survey data collection. This has significantly improved efficiency, enabling UBOS to release the 2024 National Population and Housing Census report within six months, a major improvement from the previous two-year timeline[1][3].

Regarding **constitutional AI implementation** specifically, there is no direct public record or detailed report indicating that UBOS has explicitly adopted or implemented "Constitutional AI" frameworks as defined in AI ethics and governance literature. Constitutional AI generally refers to embedding constitutional or legal principles into AI systems to ensure ethical, legal, and rights-respecting AI behavior[2][4][6]. This concept is more broadly discussed in AI governance and security contexts rather than in UBOSâ€™s current statistical AI applications.

However, Uganda as a country is developing a **human-rights
