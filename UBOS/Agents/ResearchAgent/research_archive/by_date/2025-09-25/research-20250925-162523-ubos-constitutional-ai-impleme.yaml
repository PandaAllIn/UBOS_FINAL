  content: 'The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is actively integrating Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) into its statistical governance and data collection processes,
    notably using AI-driven tools like Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)
    devices to automate census and survey data collection. This has significantly
    improved efficiency, enabling UBOS to release the 2024 National Population and
    Housing Census report within six months, a major improvement from the previous
    two-year timeline[1][3].


    Regarding **constitutional AI implementation** specifically, there is no direct
    public record or detailed report indicating that UBOS has explicitly adopted or
    implemented "Constitutional AI" frameworks as defined in AI ethics and governance
    literature. Constitutional AI generally refers to embedding constitutional or
    legal principles into AI systems to ensure ethical, legal, and rights-respecting
    AI behavior[2][4][6]. This concept is more broadly discussed in AI governance
    and security contexts rather than in UBOSâ€™s current statistical AI applications.


    However, Uganda as a country is developing a **human-rights'
