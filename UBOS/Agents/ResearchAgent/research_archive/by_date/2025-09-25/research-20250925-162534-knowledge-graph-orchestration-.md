## Research Findings
**Summary:** **Knowledge graph orchestration strategies** involve designing, managing, and integrating the components and workflows that build, update, and utilize knowledge graphs effectively.

### Content
**Knowledge graph orchestration strategies** involve designing, managing, and integrating the components and workflows that build, update, and utilize knowledge graphs effectively. These strategies focus on how to organize entities (nodes), relationships (edges), and schemas (organizing principles or ontologies) to ensure the knowledge graph supports accurate, context-aware querying and AI applications.

Key orchestration strategies include:

- **Schema and Ontology Management:** Defining and evolving the organizing principles or ontologies that structure the graph, which act as conceptual maps or metadata layers overlaying the data. This includes dynamically constructing ontologies that represent domain concepts, attributes, and relationships to guide data integration and querying[1][2][5].

- **Entity and Relationship Extraction and Disambiguation:** Extracting meaningful entities from unstructured data (e.g., natural language) and correctly identifying their context-dependent meanings. This often involves context-aware annotation and disambiguation to map entities accurately in the graph, crucial for maintaining data quality and relevanc
