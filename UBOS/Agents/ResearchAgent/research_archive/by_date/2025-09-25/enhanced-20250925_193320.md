## Research Findings
**Summary:** Constitutional AI research on: UBOS constitutional AI testing

### Content
There is no public evidence that the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is currently conducting formal "constitutional AI testing" in the sense defined by leading AI research (such as Anthropic's Constitutional AI, which uses a set of written principles to guide AI behavior and reduce reliance on human feedback)[2][4]. Instead, UBOS is actively integrating **AI technologies** to improve statistical data collection and governance, focusing on efficiency, accuracy, and timely reporting[1][3].

**Key context:**
- **UBOS has benchmarked with the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department** to enhance its use of AI in statistical processes, particularly for data collection and management[1][3].
- The main AI applications at UBOS involve tools like **Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) devices** to speed up census data collection and reporting, not constitutional AI alignment or testing[1][3].
- **Constitutional AI**, as defined by Anthropic and academic literature, refers to training AI systems using a set of explicit principles (a "constitution") to ensure outputs are helpful, honest, and harmless, often replacing or supplementing human feedback in the training process[2][4]. There is no indication UBOS is using this approach.

**Summary Table: UBOS AI Activities vs. Constitutional AI**

| Aspect                         | UBOS AI Activities                              | Constitutional AI (Anthropic/Academic)         |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Main Purpose                   | Improve statistical data collection & reporting | Align AI with human values via principles     |
| Methods                        | CAPI devices, digital data tools                | Principle-based self-critique & RL from AI    |
| Human Feedback Role            | Central (enumerators, statisticians)            | Minimized, replaced by written principles     |
| Evidence of Constitutional AI? | No                                              | N/A                                           |

If you are referring to a different meaning of "constitutional AI testing" specific to UBOS or Uganda, there is no documentation or reporting on such an initiative in the available sources as of June 2025.
