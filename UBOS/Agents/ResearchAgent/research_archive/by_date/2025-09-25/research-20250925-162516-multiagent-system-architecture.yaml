  content: "**Multi-agent system architecture patterns** are structured ways to organize\
    \ multiple autonomous agents so they can collaborate, coordinate, and complete\
    \ complex tasks efficiently. Key patterns include:\n\n1. **Supervisor Pattern**\
    \  \n   A single *supervisor agent* controls the workflow by receiving a task,\
    \ breaking it into sub-tasks, delegating these to specialized agents, and managing\
    \ the execution order and data flow. This pattern is common for workflows requiring\
    \ centralized coordination, such as hospital appointment scheduling where the\
    \ supervisor delegates to scheduler, records, summarizer, and notification agents[1][2].\n\
    \n2. **Hierarchical Pattern**  \n   An extension of the supervisor pattern with\
    \ multiple layers of supervisors. A top-level agent delegates to mid-level agents,\
    \ which further distribute tasks to lower-level agents. This is suited for complex\
    \ systems where responsibilities are split across domains or teams, like enterprise\
    \ document processing pipelines[1][2][3].\n\n3. **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**\
    \  \n   A central orchestrator assigns task"
