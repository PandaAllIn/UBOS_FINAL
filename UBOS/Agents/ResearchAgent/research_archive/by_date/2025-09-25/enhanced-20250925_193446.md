### Content
There is no evidence that the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is currently conducting or piloting "constitutional AI" testing in the sense defined by Anthropic or the broader AI alignment community. Instead, UBOS is focused on integrating **AI technologies** to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of its **statistical data collection and governance**[1][3].

**Key points:**

- **UBOS and AI Integration:** UBOS has recently benchmarked with the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department to enhance its use of AI in statistical processes, particularly highlighting the use of Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) devices during the 2024 National Population and Housing Census[1][3]. This has led to significantly faster data reporting and improved data quality.

- **No Evidence of Constitutional AI Testing:** The concept of **"constitutional AI"**—as introduced by Anthropic—refers to training AI systems using a set of human-written principles (a "constitution") to guide AI behavior toward being helpful, honest, and harmless, with minimal reliance on human feedback[2][4]. There is no indication in the available sources that UBOS is experimenting with or deploying this specific approach.

- **UBOS’s AI Focus:** UBOS’s AI efforts are currently centered on:
  - Improving data collection methods (e.g., digital interviews, CAPI)
  - Enhancing statistical governance and data quality
  - Learning international best practices for statistical management and communication[1][3]

- **Constitutional AI in Context:** The term "constitutional AI" is a technical methodology developed by Anthropic for aligning large language models with human values, distinct from general AI adoption in statistical agencies[2][4].

If you are referring to UBOS testing AI systems that are explicitly guided by a constitutional framework of principles (as per Anthropic’s definition), there is no public record or reporting of such activity as of September 2025. UBOS’s current AI initiatives are focused on practical improvements in statistical operations rather than on advanced AI alignment research.
