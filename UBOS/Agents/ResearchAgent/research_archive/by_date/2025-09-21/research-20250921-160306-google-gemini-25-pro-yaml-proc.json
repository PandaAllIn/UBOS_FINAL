    "content": "Google Gemini 2.5 Pro has **strong code processing capabilities** and supports advanced reasoning across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio, video, and codebases. However, there is no explicit mention in the available sources about **native or specialized YAML processing capabilities** as a distinct feature.\n\nKey relevant points about Gemini 2.5 Pro's processing abilities:\n\n- Gemini 2.5 Pro can handle **large codebases** (e.g., 60,000 lines of code) and complex coding tasks such as code transformation, editing, and building interactive web apps, demonstrating strong programming language understanding and generation skills[1][3][6][7].\n\n- It supports **multimodal inputs** natively, including text, images, audio, and video, enabling it to analyze and integrate information from diverse sources without separate preprocessing[2][5][8].\n\n- The model has a **very large context window** (1 million tokens, with 2 million tokens coming soon), allowing it to process extensive documents or codebases in a single pass, which is beneficial for handling complex structured data formats[2][6].\n\n- Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in **reasoning and code-related benchmarks**, indicating it can understand and generate structured data formats embedded in code or text, but YAML is not specifically cited[1][3].\n\n- The model is available via Google AI Studio, Gemini API, and Vertex AI, enabling developers to integrate it into workflows that may involve YAML processing indirectly through code or text parsing[3][5][7].\n\nIn summary, while Gemini 2.5 Pro is highly capable in coding and multimodal reasoning tasks and can likely process YAML content as part of text or code inputs, **there is no direct documentation or announcement specifying dedicated YAML processing features or optimizations**. Its general coding and text processing strengths imply it can handle YAML reasonably well, but this is an inferred capability rather than an explicitly stated one.",
