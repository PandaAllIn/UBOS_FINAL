  content: 'Google Gemini 2.5 Pro has **strong code processing capabilities** and
    supports advanced reasoning across multiple modalities, including text, images,
    audio, video, and codebases. However, there is no explicit mention in the available
    sources about **native or specialized YAML processing capabilities** as a distinct
    feature.


    Key relevant points about Gemini 2.5 Pro''s processing abilities:


    - Gemini 2.5 Pro can handle **large codebases** (e.g., 60,000 lines of code) and
    complex coding tasks such as code transformation, editing, and building interactive
    web apps, demonstrating strong programming language understanding and generation
    skills[1][3][6][7].


    - It supports **multimodal inputs** natively, including text, images, audio, and
    video, enabling it to analyze and integrate information from diverse sources without
    separate preprocessing[2][5][8].


    - The model has a **very large context window** (1 million tokens, with 2 million
    tokens coming soon), allowing it to process extensive documents or codebases in
    a single pass, which is beneficial for handling complex structured data formats[2][6].


    - Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in **reasoning and code-related benchmarks**, indicating
    it can understand and generate structured data formats embedded in code or text,
    but YAML is not specifically cited[1][3].


    - The model is available via Google AI Studio, Gemini API, and Vertex AI, enabling
    developers to integrate it into workflows that may involve YAML processing indirectly
    through code or text parsing[3][5][7].


    In summary, while Gemini 2.5 Pro is highly capable in coding and multimodal reasoning
    tasks and can likely process YAML content as part of text or code inputs, **there
    is no direct documentation or announcement specifying dedicated YAML processing
    features or optimizations**. Its general coding and text processing strengths
    imply it can handle YAML reasonably well, but this is an inferred capability rather
    than an explicitly stated one.'
