# UBOS AI Prime Agent Blueprint

## Consultation Trace
- **Question**: What strategic architecture should the AI Prime Agent adopt to orchestrate UBOS agents effectively?
- **Objective**: Define foundational blueprint for AI Prime orchestrator
- **Context**: Designing coordination layer that integrates Master Librarian and Research Agent under UBOS Chapter 4 principles
- **Consultation Timestamp**: 2025-09-22T10:11:20Z (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## Principle Deck (Extracted Guidance)
- **Systems Produce Current Results**: Change the orchestration system to change the outcome.
- **Build on Purpose, Not by Accident**: Let the Strategic Blueprint drive every interaction.
- **Structure Over Control**: Define frameworks and protocols, then let agents execute autonomously.
- **Blueprint Thinking**: Maintain a living source-of-truth that encodes goals, principles, and resources.
- **Systems Over Willpower**: Automate delegation, monitoring, and synthesis loops.
- **Strategic Pause**: Schedule reflective checkpoints that compare outcomes against the blueprint.
- **Abundance Mindset**: Design for extensibility and environmental stewardship from the first iteration.
- **Instead of Trying to Fix Everything at Once**: Launch one high-leverage workflow, then iterate.
- **You Can Have the Best Mindset in the World...**: Guard the operating environment so the system stays healthy.

## Core Orchestration Blueprint
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: AI Prime Agent Core

Philosophy: Blueprint Thinking + Structure Over Control
Strategic Purpose: Serve as the central nervous system that coordinates specialized UBOS agents toward declared missions.
System Design: Event-driven coordination loop with explicit stages (intake -> analysis -> delegation -> synthesis -> reflection), powered by a machine-readable Strategic Blueprint and an Agent Communication Protocol.
Feedback Loops: System Sensor metrics, workflow telemetry, and validation reports feed programmed Strategic Pauses after each orchestration cycle.
Environmental Support: Gemini 2.5 Pro consultations, Master Librarian knowledge graph, Research Agent intelligence feeds, secure configuration, and healthy API/service credentials.
"""
```

### Core Architectural Concepts
1. **Strategic Blueprint (Source of Truth)**: Schema capturing mission, principles, goals, registry entries, and integration endpoints.
2. **Orchestration Engine (Conductor)**: Designs workflows, publishes intent, and governs handoffs without micromanagement.
3. **System Sensor (Feedback Loop)**: Observes task outcomes, latency, adherence to schemas, and alignment signals.
4. **Leverage Prioritizer (Fulcrum)**: Selects the next high-leverage action using sensor telemetry and blueprint objectives.
5. **Digital Environment Steward (Gardener)**: Maintains API keys, resource budgets, data integrity, and operational readiness.

## Phase 1 Component Blueprints

### 1. Strategic Blueprint Schema
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: Strategic Blueprint Store

Philosophy: Build on Purpose, Not by Accident
Strategic Purpose: Encode the user's intent, principles, and resources so orchestration logic has an authoritative reference.
System Design: Versioned schema (JSON/YAML) containing missionStatement, corePrinciples, activeGoals, agentRegistry, knowledgeBaseRefs, and guardrails.
Feedback Loops: Updated whenever strategic pauses reveal drift between desired and actual system outputs.
Environmental Support: Stored alongside secure configuration, with change history and validation tooling.
"""
```

**Design Notes**
- Establish schema validators and sample payloads.
- Track blueprint provenance (timestamp, consultation source).
- Integrate with Agent Registry to keep capabilities synchronized.

### 2. Agent Registry
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: Agent Registry System

Philosophy: Structure Over Control
Strategic Purpose: Maintain live metadata about agent capabilities, contracts, and health for rapid delegation.
System Design: Registry entries with id, description, capabilities, interfaces, input_schema, output_schema, status, last_contact, and trust signals.
Feedback Loops: Heartbeat checks and workflow outcomes update availability and confidence scores.
Environmental Support: Pulls from agent specs, health endpoints, and blueprint references.
"""
```

**Design Notes**
- Provide query APIs by capability and trust level.
- Record usage metrics (latency, success_rate) for the Leverage Prioritizer.
- Support manual annotations captured during strategic pauses.

### 3. Agent Communication Protocol (Communication Bus)
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: Agent Communication Protocol

Philosophy: Systems Over Willpower
Strategic Purpose: Standardize task exchange so orchestration flows without manual mediation.
System Design: Message envelope `{task_id, parent_task_id, stage, issuing_agent, target_agent, payload, output_schema, metadata, timestamp}` with validation and correlation IDs.
Feedback Loops: Delivery metrics, retries, and schema adherence logged to the System Sensor.
Environmental Support: Shared serialization utilities, secured transport (initially in-process, future queue/MCP adapters).
"""
```

**Design Notes**
- Provide synchronous stub dispatcher with hooks for async expansion.
- Persist transcripts for audit and post-mortems.
- Embed UBOS principle tags in metadata for downstream validation.

### 4. Strategic Pause Module
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: Strategic Pause Module

Philosophy: Strategic Pause + Systems Produce Current Results
Strategic Purpose: Insert automated reflection checkpoints before delegation, after synthesis, and on scheduled reviews.
System Design: Configurable hooks that ingest sensor telemetry, compare against blueprint KPIs, and decide proceed, adjust, or escalate.
Feedback Loops: Logs evaluation outcomes, consultation prompts, and blueprint adjustments.
Environmental Support: Access to sensor dashboards, registry metrics, and Gemini consultation interface.
"""
```

**Design Notes**
- Implement quick heuristic checks (e.g., goal coverage, risk flags) before optional Gemini escalation.
- Produce structured pause reports stored alongside workflow transcripts.
- Trigger blueprint diffs when repeated misalignment is detected.

### 5. Blueprint Validation Service
```
"""
UBOS Blueprint: Blueprint Validation Service

Philosophy: Structure Over Control + Blueprint Thinking
Strategic Purpose: Confirm that proposed or completed actions align with declared goals, principles, and output schemas.
System Design: Rule engine + optional Gemini 2.5 Pro check that inspects payloads, UBOS tags, and success metrics before committing results.
Feedback Loops: Validation outcomes feed the System Sensor and annotate the blueprint change log.
Environmental Support: Access to concept embeddings, agent registry metadata, and strategic blueprint fields.
"""
```

**Design Notes**
- Start with deterministic rule checks (goal coverage, schema conformity, risk warnings).
- Allow consultation-backed overrides with recorded rationale.
- Surface repeated validation failures to the Leverage Prioritizer for structural improvements.

## Immediate Steps from Consultation
1. Draft Strategic Blueprint v1.0 schema (missionStatement, corePrinciples, activeGoals, agentRegistry, knowledgeBaseRefs).
2. Define Agent Communication Protocol v0.1 with message envelope and output schema references.
3. Implement 'Research & Synthesize' pilot workflow (Prime -> Research Agent -> Master Librarian -> Validation).
4. Schedule automated System Sensor review after the pilot executes (success rate, latency, schema adherence).

## Phase 1 Milestones & Feedback Cadence
- **M1**: Strategic Blueprint schema + validation utilities -> review via quick strategic pause.
- **M2**: Agent Registry CRUD + capability queries + sensor integration -> capture health metrics.
- **M3**: Agent Communication Protocol + transcript logging -> analyze delivery telemetry.
- **M4**: Strategic Pause module + Blueprint Validation service -> generate alignment reports per workflow.

Feedback reviews remain **daily for active development** (quick pause) and **weekly** retrospectives to adjust the blueprint and registries.
