# AI Prime Agent — Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 (Completed)
- Protocol v0.1 (TaskMessage, ACK/NACK, validation)
- In‑process Bus with transcript observers
- Orchestrator skeleton
- Tests for protocol/bus/orchestrator

## Phase 2 (Completed)
- Adapters: Research (stub), Librarian (stub)
- Pilot workflow: Research & Synthesize
- Integration tests for adapters + workflow

## Phase 3 (Completed)
- Strategic Pause (pre/post) + tests
- Blueprint Validation service + tests
- Transcript logging (JSONL) + tests

## Phase 4 (Completed)
- CLI with real adapters support (Librarian REST, Research CLI)
- Reporting utility (JSON/Markdown/Mermaid) and CLI flag
- E2E test harness (skipped by default; requires keys)

## Next (Optional Enhancements)
- Add metrics aggregation (success/latency) from transcripts
- Add minimal auth/rate-limiting on Librarian; propagate tokens in Prime
- Containerize Prime and expose a REST endpoint for workflows
- Persist registry and transcripts to a store (SQLite/S3)
- Add retries/timeout policies to adapters; circuit breaker on repeated failures
