# Agent Summoner - Constitutional Dynamic Agent Creation

**Philosophy**: Blueprint Thinking + Systems Over Willpower  
**Strategic Purpose**: Create specialized agents that inherit UBOS constitutional principles from birth.  
**System Design**: Template-based summoning with constitutional validation and lifecycle management.  
**Feedback Loops**: All summoned agents report to registry; constitutional compliance monitored.  
**Environmental Support**: Integrates with existing AgentRegistry, StrategicBlueprint, and StrategicPause.

## Overview

The Agent Summoner enables the AI Prime Agent to dynamically create specialized agents while maintaining strict constitutional compliance with UBOS principles. Every summoned agent inherits constitutional DNA from birth.

## Key Features

### Constitutional Agent Factory
- **Template-Based Creation**: Pre-configured agent templates with built-in UBOS compliance
- **Constitutional Validation**: Every agent validated against UBOS principles before activation
- **Dynamic Capabilities**: Summon agents with specific capabilities as needed

### Constitutional Governance
- **Blueprint Alignment**: All agents align with the Strategic Blueprint
- **Principle Enforcement**: Built-in enforcement of UBOS constitutional principles
- **Lifecycle Management**: Constitutional oversight of agent birth, operation, and retirement

## Quick Start

```python
from ai_prime_agent.blueprint.schema import StrategicBlueprint
from agent_summoner import ConstitutionalSummoner, AgentTemplateRegistry
from ai_prime_agent.registry import AgentRegistry

# Create summoner
blueprint = StrategicBlueprint(...)
registry = AgentRegistry()
template_registry = AgentTemplateRegistry()
summoner = ConstitutionalSummoner(blueprint, registry, template_registry)

# Summon a constitutional agent
agent = summoner.summon_agent("eu_grant_specialist")
```

## Available Templates

### EU Grant Specialist
- **Purpose**: EU funding application expertise
- **Capabilities**: `eu_grant.research`, `eu_grant.generate_application`
- **Constitutional Focus**: European democratic values, UBOS principles

### Specification Agent
- **Purpose**: Complex task specification and breakdown
- **Capabilities**: `specification.analyze_task`
- **Constitutional Focus**: Blueprint Thinking, Strategic Pause, Systems Over Willpower

### Research Specialist
- **Purpose**: Specialized research with constitutional alignment
- **Capabilities**: `research.specialized_query`
- **Constitutional Focus**: Strategic Pause, Blueprint Thinking, Systems Over Willpower

## Constitutional Principles

All summoned agents inherit these UBOS principles:

1. **Blueprint Thinking**: Intentional design before action
2. **Systems Over Willpower**: Structural solutions over emotional motivation
3. **Strategic Pause**: Analysis before response
4. **Abundance Mindset**: Framework-driven growth

## Testing

Run the test suite to validate functionality:

```bash
cd UBOS/Agents/AgentSummoner
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Integration

The Agent Summoner integrates seamlessly with existing UBOS components:

- **Strategic Blueprint**: Constitutional alignment validation
- **Agent Registry**: Automatic agent registration
- **Strategic Pause**: Pre/post summoning validation
- **Blueprint Validator**: Constitutional compliance checking

**The Agent Summoner transforms UBOS from a fixed multi-agent system into a living constitutional democracy that can evolve its own capabilities while maintaining strict constitutional compliance.** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
