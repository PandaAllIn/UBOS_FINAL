# Chapter 06 â€“ Timing is Strategy - When to Move and When to Wait

Timing is strategy. When to move and when to wait. There's a saying among seasoned strategists, the right move at the wrong time is still the wrong move. Power, insight, even bold vision. None of it matters if your timing is off. If you move too soon, you waste energy. If you wait too long, you miss opportunity. But if you strike at the perfect moment, suddenly the world opens up. That's what this chapter is all about. Not just knowing what to do, but knowing when to do it. Timing is strategy. It's the quiet force behind every major breakthrough, every decisive win, every brilliant decision that looks effortless in hindsight. Let's dive in. Why patience is the ultimate strategic weapon. Let's start with a tough truth. Most people lose not because they lack ideas, ambition, or talent, but because they move too fast. They chase the short-term win. They act on impulse. They push when they should pause. Why? Because patience feels like weakness. It feels like doing nothing. But in reality, patience is power in disguise. True strategic patience is active. It means waiting with awareness, preparing while others panic, observing when others rush. Think about nature. The eagle doesn't flap around. It soarses, waits, watches, and then dives. The archer doesn't shoot immediately. They draw, aim, breathe, then release. A seasoned negotiator doesn't speak first. They listen, analyze, and respond with precision. This kind of waiting isn't passive. It's precise. It's knowing. The difference between motion and progress. And most importantly, it's understanding that the goal isn't to act fast, it's to act right. Identifying high leverage moments. So, how do you know when it's the right time to move? Welcome to the concept of leverage points, moments where small actions create massive results. High leverage moments are the sweet spot of strategy. The one conversation that shifts an entire deal. The one tweak that transforms a failing project. The one message sent at just the right hour. But these moments are easy to miss unless you're looking for them. Here's how to identify them. Watch for tension peaks. Often the best time to act is when tension is highest. When your action can bring clarity, resolution or release. In negotiation, this is when silence has stretched and the other side is leaning in. Time the market, not the mood. Whether it's business, relationships, or career decisions, align your moves with external readiness, not internal impatience. Feelings lie, patterns don't. Monitor signals, not just noise. Look for signs beneath the surface. Shifts in behavior, timing, readiness, or power. Often, opportunity whispers before it knocks. Leverage the readiness window. Timing isn't just about your readiness. It's about the world's readiness. Don't launch too early. Build anticipation. Don't wait too long. Ride the momentum. Think of it like surfing. You don't control the waves, but if you learn to read them, you know exactly when to paddle, when to rise, and when to ride, avoiding impulse decisions. Let's talk about the enemy of great timing, impulsiveness. We've all been there. You feel a spark, a surge, a burst of inspiration, and before you know it, you've hit send, made the call, pulled the trigger. Sometimes it works. Most times it doesn't because impulsive decisions are reactive. They feel urgent but often lack context. And in strategy, context is everything. Here's how to avoid impulse decisions without losing your edge. Build in a delay rule. For any big decision, pause for 24 hours. This one habit alone can save you thousands in regret. Ask the 5-year question. Will this matter in 5 years? This reframes temporary emotion into long-term thinking. Check your triggers. Recognize what throws off your timing. Fear, ego, boredom, urgency. Once you spot the trigger, you can stop the spiral. Consult a neutral voice. A trusted friend or mentor can be your mirror. If they're not emotionally involved, they'll see the timing gaps you might miss. Shift from reaction to response. Reacting is instant. Responding is intentional. Always aim for the latter. Remember, strategy is about stacking the odds in your favor, not gambling on adrenaline, escaping analysis. Paralysis. Now, let's swing to the opposite extreme. Overthinking. Some people wait too long. They analyze every angle, run every scenario, imagine every failure. They don't miss the train because they were late. They miss it because they never boarded. That's analysis paralysis. Here's how to move through it without losing strategic precision. Set a decision deadline. Give yourself a realistic but firm timeline to decide. Clarity loves a clock. Define enough information. Strategic thinkers know when they've gathered enough intel to move. You don't need all the facts, just the right ones. Use the 70% rule. If you're 70% confident, move. Waiting for 100% certainty leads to missed windows. Even Jeff Bezos uses this model to act decisively. Trust the process, not just the outcome. Sometimes you can't guarantee the result. But if your thinking is clear, your timing is usually close. Remember, perfection is the enemy of progress. Many high performers wait for the perfect plan, but perfect is a myth. Momentum matters more than mastery. You can always adjust midcourse, but you can't steer a parked car. The strategic sweet spot, balancing speed and stillness. So, how do you balance it all? Here's the truth. Strategy is a dance between patience and precision. You need to wait long enough to see the full picture, but act fast enough to seize your moment. It's the art of being ready and patient. So when your moment arrives, you don't hesitate. You move with confidence, with power, with clarity. Here's what that looks like. A founder who doesn't rush to launch, but doesn't miss their market window. A job seeker who waits for alignment, not just availability. A creative who doesn't publish before the work is great, but doesn't overedit forever. This is the sweet spot of strategic timing. And when you master it, you stop chasing life and start meeting it exactly where it's most powerful. Final thoughts. Time is not your enemy. It's your weapon. Timing isn't just a detail of strategy. It's the heartbeat of it. Move too soon and you fail. Move too late and you miss, but move just right and the world bends in your favor. So, here's your new mindset. I don't need to rush. I don't need to wait. I need to read the moment and then move with precision. Whether it's a business deal, a big life change, or a simple daily decision, the more you trust in timing, the more powerful your presence becomes. Because in the end, great strategists don't force the game. They feel the rhythm and then they make their move.
