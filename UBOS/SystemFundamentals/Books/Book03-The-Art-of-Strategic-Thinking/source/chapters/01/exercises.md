# Exercises

- Imagine this
- Ask yourself, where do I want to be 6 months from now?
- Ask better questions
- Ask, "If I do this, what happens next?" Just like chess, life rewards those who can anticipate, not just respond
- Practice the pause
- Ask the smarter question
- Choose the next move, not the next impulse
