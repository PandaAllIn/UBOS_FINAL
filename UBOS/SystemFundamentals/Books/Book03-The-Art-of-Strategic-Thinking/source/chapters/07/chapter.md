# Chapter 07 â€“ Leverage - How to Win with Less Effort

Leverage. How to win with less effort. There's a secret behind every outsiz success story. It's not always about hustle. It's not about working 18our days grinding through burnout or carrying the whole weight on your shoulders. It's about leverage. Leverage means using a small input to create a massive output. Think of it like this. A single person can't lift a car. But give them a hydraulic jack, a tool that multiplies their strength. And suddenly what was impossible becomes effortless. That's leverage and it's available to you right now. You don't need superpowers. You just need to think like a strategist. In this chapter, we'll explore how to spot your hidden leverage points. Work smarter, not just harder. Use people, tools, and systems to multiply your power. Ready to stop pushing harder and start pulling smarter? Let's begin what leverage really means. Leverage is one of those words people toss around without really defining. In strategic thinking, leverage is this. Using minimal effort, resources, or time to generate maximum impact. It's about creating a force multiplier. A way to make one action produce exponential results. Here are a few real world examples. A single social media post that brings in thousands of customers. An automation that saves you 5 hours a week. A connection that opens doors to new partnerships or opportunities. A decision that removes 10 daily problems at once. The best strategists aren't just asking, "What do I need to do?" They're asking, "How can I make this easier, smarter, and more effective?" That mindset changes everything. Step one, identifying your leverage points. The first move is simple but powerful. Spot where your leverage lives. Look at your goals. Now ask, where am I putting in 80% effort for 20% result? Where am I getting 80% of my results from only 20% of my actions? This is the famous 8020 rule, also known as the Parto principle. It tells us most of our results come from a small number of our inputs. The trick is to double down on the few things that matter most. Here are four common leverage points to examine in your own life. Time leverage. What tasks can you automate, delegate, or eliminate? Skill leverage. What unique skill gives you the biggest return? Are you maximizing it? Network leverage. Who do you know that already has access, answers, or influence? Platform leverage. Are you building assets like content, tools, or reputation that work while you sleep? The goal isn't to do more, it's to do less better. Step two, working smarter, not harder. There's a myth that success only comes from hard work. And while effort matters, it's smart effort that truly separates winners from the worn out. Here's how to shift into working smarter. Batch and block group similar tasks together like emails, meetings, creative work, and handle them in focus time blocks. This minimizes mental switching and boosts efficiency. Systematize repetition. Anything you do more than twice, build a process, templates, checklists, standard operating procedures. These aren't just for businesses. They're for anyone who values time. Use the rule of three. Pick three high impact tasks per day. If everything's a priority, nothing is. Focus creates leverage. Ask better questions instead of how can I get this done? Ask how can this get done without me? How can this get done faster? What would make this unnecessary? Strategic questions create smarter paths. Step three, leveraging relationships. One of the most powerful but underused forms of leverage other people. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Isaac Newton. You don't have to know everything. You just have to know someone who does. Here's how to build relationship leverage the right way. Be a giver. First, help others solve problems. Offer value before asking for it. This builds trust and trust is leverage. Map your network. Who do you know? What are they great at? Where are the gaps you can fill or where they can fill yours? Make a personal strategic relationship map. You'll be surprised how connected you already are. Collaborate. Don't compete. Find people with complimentary strengths. Partner on projects. Co-create. 1 plus 1 can equal five when the synergy is right. Leverage mentors and allies. A 30inut conversation with the right mentor can save you three years of trial and error. Don't be afraid to reach out, ask questions, and listen deeply. People are not just contacts, they are catalysts. Step four, leveraging technology and tools. We live in an era where technology is leveraged on tap. Yet many people still use their smartphones to scroll instead of solve. Here's how to turn tools into time savers, not time wasters. Duh. Automate repetitive tasks. Use tools like Calendarly for scheduling. Zapia for workflow automation. AI tools for writing, summarizing, or research. Every minute you automate is a minute you reclaim. Use AI as an amplifier, not a replacement. Smart strategists don't fear technology. They use it to think faster, research deeper, and execute cleaner. Ask yourself, what can AI help me start, speed up, or simplify? Free. Build or use systems, create dashboards, spreadsheets, templates, or databases that organize your work and free your brain for higher level thinking. Invest once, benefit. often buy the for write gear, software, or setup once and let it serve you for years. One-time investments often produce long-term leverage. Remember, every tool is either a lever or a distraction. Choose wisely. Step five, leveraging resources. Strategically, resources aren't just money. They're time, energy, knowledge, people, and positioning. Strategic thinkers ask, "What do I already have that I'm not using? What resource do I need that could change everything? How can I turn what I lack into creative advantage? Some ways to use resources better. Repurpose old work into new value. Turn blog posts into a book, videos into courses, barter skills instead of buying services. find underutilized assets, space, tools, people, and reframe their use. Leverage is rarely about more. It's about better. Final mindset shift. Leverage is not laziness. Some people confuse leverage with laziness. They say that's a shortcut or real success takes sweat. Here's the truth. Leverage isn't about escaping work. It's about designing your effort so every ounce matters. It's the difference between digging with a spoon or digging with an excavator. It's not cheating. It's thinking. And the moment you realize that, you unlock a new level of possibility. Final thoughts. Build a life that compounds. The most powerful use of leverage. Creating things that compound. That means building relationships that grow over time. creating content or assets that work while you sleep. Designing habits and systems that improve with each use. Leverage isn't just about today's effort. It's about setting up winds that stack tomorrow and the day after and the day after that. Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I will move the world. Archimedes, you have the lever. You're finding the place to stand. And now you're ready to move mountains with less force, more finesse, and strategic power that multiplies.
