# Tools

- `parse_book.py` — parse the book manuscript into schema-compliant chapter folders.
- `build_aggregates.py` — generate JSONL aggregates under `chapters/all/`.
- `export_for_agents.py` — produce quick-reference JSON bundles in `agent_exports/`.
- `generate_markdown_sources.py` — sync `source/chapters/` (chapter markdown, key ideas, exercises, quotes).

Run these scripts from the book's `ai-structured/tools/` directory (or repo root) as needed.
