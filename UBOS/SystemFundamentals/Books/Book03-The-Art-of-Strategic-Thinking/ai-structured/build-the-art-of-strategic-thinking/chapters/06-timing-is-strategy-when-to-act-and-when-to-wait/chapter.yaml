title: "Timing Is Strategy \u2013 When to Act and When to Wait"
summary: Timing is strategy. When to move and when to wait. There's a saying among
  seasoned strategists, the right move at the wrong time is still the wrong move.
  Power, insight, even bold vision. None of it matters if your timing is off. If you
  move too soon, you waste energy.
objectives:
- Respect timing as a strategic lever, not a coincidence.
- Balance patience and precision when selecting the next move.
- Create readiness rituals so opportunity meets prepared execution.
