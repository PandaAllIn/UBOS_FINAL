# Chapter Guide â€” Build the System

This guide captures the high-level intent of each chapter so agents have context before authoring granular idea/practice/quote records. Use it as the authoritative mapping between chapter themes and the schema assets that must be produced.

## Usage Notes
- Treat the "Primary System Themes" column as the allowable topic subset when tagging ideas or practices for the chapter.
- Ensure every chapter outputs at least one principle, one actionable practice, and one quote collection. Some chapters may merit additional record types (e.g., layered frameworks for Chapter 12).
- When in doubt, consult the raw artifacts under `../source/BuildTheSystem/<chapter-folder>/` and `../source/docs/chapters/<id>/`.

## Preparation Checklist Per Chapter
1. Review `chapter-summary.md`, `key-concepts.md`, `actionable-insights.md`, and full text in `../source/docs/chapters/<id>/chapter.md`.
2. Draft a bullet outline of candidate ideas, practices, and quotes referencing source lines.
3. Validate topics against the table above.
4. Hand outline to SpecsAgent for spec generation.

Update this guide if deeper review reveals new dominant themes.
