chapter: '10'
kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: It's either supporting your system or sabotaging it. But over time, the environment
  shapes your habits, your energy levels, your focus, and even your identity. Designing
  a supportive environment doesn't require money. It means protecting your system
  from the energy of those who aren't building anything of their own. Environmental
  design is not about control. Each of these is a signal, a cue, a system component.
  You're shaping an ecosystem that makes the desired behavior the natural behavior.
  The mess you ignore, the distractions you let in, the boundaries you fail to set,
  these all become parts of your system.
context: Key takeaway from the chapter.
