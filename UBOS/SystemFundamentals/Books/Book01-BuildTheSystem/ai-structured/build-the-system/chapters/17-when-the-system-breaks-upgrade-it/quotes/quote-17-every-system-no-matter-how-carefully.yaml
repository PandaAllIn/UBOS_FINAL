kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: Every system, no matter how carefully designed, eventually encounters friction.
  What matters most in those moments isn't whether your system failed. Because systems
  are not meant to be permanent. When a system breaks, it's not a sign that you failed.
  The most common mistake people make when a system fails is blaming themselves instead
  of examining the structure. They think they just weren't disciplined enough, motivated
  enough, focused enough. The system didn't support the pressure, the pace, or the
  season. Growth is what breaks systems. As you evolve, your life becomes more complex.
