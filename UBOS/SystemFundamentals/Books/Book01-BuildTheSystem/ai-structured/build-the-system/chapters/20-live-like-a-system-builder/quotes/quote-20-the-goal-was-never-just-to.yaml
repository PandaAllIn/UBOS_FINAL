speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: The goal was never just to build a system. Because systems don't only serve
  you, they shape you. You become a system builder, someone who doesn't chase outcomes,
  but creates the conditions in which outcomes emerge. Living like a system builder
  means seeing life through the lens of structure and sustainability. System builders
  understand that their future is their responsibility. Living like a system builder
  also changes your relationship with time. You also start designing systems in more
  areas of your life. You start seeing them as integrated parts of a larger ecosystem.
