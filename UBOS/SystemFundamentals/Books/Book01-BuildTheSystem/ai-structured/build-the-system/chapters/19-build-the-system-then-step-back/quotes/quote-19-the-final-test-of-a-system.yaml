speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: The final test of a system is whether it can run without constant supervision.
  But control is not the goal of building systems. Freedom is. You don't build a system
  so you can micromanage it. It means recognizing that a system once welldesigned
  should be able to operate with minimal friction. So, when the system starts to work
  without them, they panic. You adjust when appropriate, but your presence is not
  required for the system to function. Always being inside the system makes it harder
  to see what needs to be improved. This is especially important if your system involves
  other people.
