text: Scaling anything before it's been systemized is a recipe for failure. Systemizing
  means creating a foundation that runs without constant improvisation. When you systemize
  properly, growth becomes a natural extension of the structure. You can scale with
  clarity knowing your system will hold under pressure, but systemizing requires discipline.
  When you systemize, you create repeatability. One of the most valuable aspects of
  a systemized structure is that it allows other people to step in. Systemizing means
  creating documentation, templates, and guidelines that allow others to contribute
  without confusion. Not by doing more, but by designing systems that can run without
  constant supervision.
