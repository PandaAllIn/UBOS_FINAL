kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: If you're feeding your system chaos, distraction, or negativity, your outcomes
  will always reflect that. In an abundance-based system, inputs are not background
  noise. The people who create consistently excellent results aren't just more focused.
  Media is designed to provoke outrage. and social feeds are endless loops of comparison
  and noise. You must become the gatekeeper of your system, not to block the world
  out, but to filter it through intention. A high performance system doesn't avoid
  input. These small shifts create large returns in focus, clarity, and creativity.
  They reduce the cognitive junk that slows your system down.
