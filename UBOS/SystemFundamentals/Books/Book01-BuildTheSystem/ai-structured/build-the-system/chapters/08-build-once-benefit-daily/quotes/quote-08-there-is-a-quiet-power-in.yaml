speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: There is a quiet power in systems that require one act of creation and then
  serve you again and again. Their days are filled with effort, but their systems
  produce nothing that outlives the moment. You spend energy once designing a habit
  that removes decision-making from your morning routine. They are not Instagrammable,
  but they are the bedrock of a systemized scalable life. To live in abundance, you
  must learn to shift from reacting to designing. When systems run in the background,
  your mental bandwidth is freed up for high leverage thinking and deep creative work.
  You've designed your environment and your routine so that good choices happen by
  default. It's important to understand that not every system has to be digital or
  complex.
