kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: This internal narrative functions like an operating system. People who have
  strong external systems but weak internal belief structures tend to sabotage their
  own momentum. The reason many people fail to sustain change is because their systems
  are built on top of an old identity. No matter how advanced the system, if the story
  you're telling yourself contradicts it, the story wins. Your decisions become clearer
  and your systems become easier to follow. The system of self-belief begins with
  awareness. A powerful belief system, on the other hand, responds with curiosity
  and accountability. The system of self-belief requires boundaries.
