kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: Without it, even the best systems collapse under confusion. This is where real
  system building begins. You can't build a system for a life you haven't imagined
  with clarity. And if you're not willing to do this part, every system you try to
  build will feel hollow, misaligned, or forced. Their systems follow their vision,
  not the other way around. It might mean redesigning your work environment to support
  focus or carving out non-negotiable time for rest. Definition creates alignment
  and alignment allows systems to function with less resistance. This is how people
  move from scattered ambition to focused momentum.
