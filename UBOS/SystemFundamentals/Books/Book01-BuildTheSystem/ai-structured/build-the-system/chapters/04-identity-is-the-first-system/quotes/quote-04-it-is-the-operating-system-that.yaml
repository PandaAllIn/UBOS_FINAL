kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: It is the operating system that determines what kind of future you are able
  to sustain. We often try to build our lives by focusing on external results. But
  the truth is that no system can consistently outperform the identity it's built
  upon. Over time, the new identity stabilizes and with it, the system that supports
  your future becomes easier to maintain. The system supports itself because it's
  operating in harmony with your belief about who you are. Every aligned action is
  a brick in the foundation of your new system. And when identity shifts, systems
  become easier to build and sustain. That's when you know the system is taking root.
