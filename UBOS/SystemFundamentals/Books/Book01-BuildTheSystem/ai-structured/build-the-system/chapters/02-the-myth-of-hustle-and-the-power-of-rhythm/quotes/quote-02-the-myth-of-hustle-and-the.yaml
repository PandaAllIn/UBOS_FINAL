text: The myth of hustle and the power of rhythm. The abundance mindset doesn't reject
  hard work, but it redefes its context. Rhythm is what converts energy into results
  without collapse. Rhythm asks, "How do I build something that works even when I'm
  not at my best?" Hustle never asks that question. True abundance can't exist without
  rhythm. Because abundance is a long game, and long games are one with systems, not
  sprints. People resist rhythm because it feels slower at first. But rhythm gives
  you something hustle never can.
