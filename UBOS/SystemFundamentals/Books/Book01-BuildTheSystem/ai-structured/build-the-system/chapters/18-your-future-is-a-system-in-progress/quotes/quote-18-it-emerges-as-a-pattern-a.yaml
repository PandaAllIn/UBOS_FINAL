speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: It emerges as a pattern, a byproduct of your current design. But a future built
  by design follows a different path. The beauty of a future built through systems
  is that it doesn't rely on willpower or luck. You just need to create a system that
  supports the next step and then another and then another. They're built with adaptable
  systems because your goals will evolve. And your system must be able to grow with
  you. A system that supports your future includes multiple dimensions. The goal is
  to design systems that create wholeness across all of them.
