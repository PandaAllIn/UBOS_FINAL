speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: It shifts the focus from intensity to consistency. Every small effort becomes
  a contribution to the larger architecture. You've already built the system that
  can hold it. That's how you build resilience by layering systems that support you
  even when motivation is low or circumstances shift. The people who live in consistent
  abundance are rarely the loudest. Their systems evolve slowly but deliberately.
  To begin thinking in layers, start by identifying which parts of your system need
  strengthening. System builders know that real change comes from sustained layers,
  not sudden overhauls.
