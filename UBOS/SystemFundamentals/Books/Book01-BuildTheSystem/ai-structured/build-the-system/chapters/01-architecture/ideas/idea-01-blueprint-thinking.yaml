title: Blueprint Thinking
one_liner: "Every abundant life begins with a deliberate blueprint, not improvisation."
description: |
  The chapter opens by comparing life design to skyscraper construction: no lasting structure goes up without
  a carefully drafted plan. Abundance is engineered by specifying the architecture of thoughts, systems,
  and alignment before chasing outcomes. Treating the future as a build requires slowing down to map the
  foundational structure that can hold long-term ambition.
