title: Alignment Diagnostic Questions
one_liner: "Four core questions reveal whether your architecture supports the life you claim to want."
description: |
  Alignment starts by interrogating the system with intentional prompts: What life do you want daily?
  Which emotional state must be sustained? What work brings you alive? Which routines drain you?
  Answering these questions surfaces the structural gaps between current design and desired identity,
  directing attention toward upgrades that actually matter.
