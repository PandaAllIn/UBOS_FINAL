title: Garden Ecosystem Design
one_liner: "Like a garden, your life flourishes when the environment supports the seeds you plant."
description: |
  The author asks readers to see life as an ecosystem. Intentions, values, and ideas are seeds that only grow
  when the surrounding environment—time, energy, physical space—is designed to nourish them. System builders
  focus on shaping the soil, sunlight, and watering schedule so growth becomes natural rather than forced.
