title: Micro-Systems Stack Identity
one_liner: "Consistently executed micro-systems transform you from reactive to intentional."
description: |
  The chapter advocates starting with one corner of life and building a micro-system that works every day.
  As these small systems accumulate, they reshape identityâ€”you become someone who designs, not someone who reacts.
  Consistency and stacking replace complexity and spurts of effort.
topics:
  - routine
  - habit
  - identity

actions:
  - Define the smallest daily system you can execute reliably for the next 14 days.
  - After proving consistency, document how that system shifts your self-perception before adding the next layer.
