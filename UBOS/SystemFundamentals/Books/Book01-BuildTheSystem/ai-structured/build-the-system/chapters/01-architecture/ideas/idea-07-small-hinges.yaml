title: Small Hinges Swing Big Doors
one_liner: "Tiny architectural upgrades compound into disproportionate gains."
description: |
  Systems scale by stacking modest but consistent improvements. One restructured routine, environment tweak,
  or boundary can unlock cascading benefits. Rather than overhaul everything, system builders iterate on small
  hinges that gradually swing bigger results.
topics:
  - scale
  - structure
  - alignment

actions:
  - Choose one small routine to redesign and document downstream effects over two weeks.
  - Create a list of "hinge" opportunities where minor changes could free significant capacity.
