title: Abundance Begins with Architecture
summary: |
  Abundance is engineered by designing intentional life architecture before chasing outcomes. The chapter
  shows how existing routines already form a system, introduces alignment diagnostics, and urges builders to
  start with small structural upgrades that compound into identity change.
objectives:
  - Recognize that current results are produced by existing system design.
  - Use alignment questions to expose structural gaps.
  - Launch micro-systems that stack toward a deliberate architecture.
