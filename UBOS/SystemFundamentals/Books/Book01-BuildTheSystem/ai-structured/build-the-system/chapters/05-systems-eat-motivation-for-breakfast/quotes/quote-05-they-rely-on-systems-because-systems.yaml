kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: They rely on systems because systems don't ask how you feel. They understand
  that when the right system is in place, action becomes automatic. They turn important
  behaviors into routines, routines into rhythms, and rhythms into results. You do
  it because it's embedded into your system of hygiene. The key to building systems
  that outlast motivation is simplicity. A good system is easy to start, easy to repeat,
  and hard to forget. But the power of the system is that it gets you started. Professionals
  rely on systems. The writer who publishes consistently doesn't always feel inspired.
