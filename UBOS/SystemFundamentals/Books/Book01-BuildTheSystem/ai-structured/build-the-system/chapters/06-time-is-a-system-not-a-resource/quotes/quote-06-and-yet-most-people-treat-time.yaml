kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: And yet, most people treat time carelessly, reacting to it rather than designing
  it. It's because they've never been taught to architect time like the system it
  is. A well-designed time system doesn't start with a to-do list. Time design begins
  when you stop asking what do I have to do today and start asking what matters most
  today. From there you can reverse engineer the hours you have into meaningful containers
  of focused energy. They use their calendar as a design canvas. And when interruptions
  arise, they're handled by system, not panic. The shift from time management to time
  design requires awareness.
