chapter: '16'
kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: They treat it like a relief valve instead of a core system. Outsourcing tasks
  when things start to break down instead of designing support from the start. It's
  about multiplying capacity, and building leverage into your system. You become the
  system and the system becomes unsustainable. You're delegating because the task
  doesn't require your unique focus or energy. Everything else can and should be systemized
  and shared. You also need to build feedback into your delegation system. Household
  routines can be systemized and shared.
