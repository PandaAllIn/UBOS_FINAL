kind: quote
speaker: Kelvin W. Nathan
text: When your systems reflect your own metrics for a rich life, wealth begins to
  flow with less resistance. It strengthens your system instead of draining it. Not
  because of flashy marketing or perfect credentials, but because your system radiates
  coherence. You place integrity in systems at the center. The longer you ignore misalignment,
  the more your system becomes self-sabotaging. That's the cost of building a system
  for the wrong life. To return to alignment, you must first pause, step back, audit
  your systems, ask yourself the hard questions. Every system starts working better
  because it's now serving a vision that's true.
