# Book 01 · AI-Structured Assets

Machine-readable assets for *Build the System*.

- `build-the-system/` — book metadata, chapter YAML, aggregates, and agent exports.
- `tools/` — parsing, aggregation, export, and markdown-sync scripts.
- `validation/` — schema and source check utilities.

Use `build-the-system/ROADMAP.md` for workflow guidance and `tools/generate_markdown_sources.py` to refresh `source/chapters/`.
