# Key Ideas

- Every system, no matter how carefully designed, eventually encounters friction.
- What matters most in those moments isn't whether your system failed.
- When a system breaks, it's not a sign that you failed.
- The most common mistake people make when a system fails is blaming themselves instead of examining the structure.
- They think they just weren't disciplined enough, motivated enough, focused enough.
- The system didn't support the pressure, the pace, or the season.
- Growth is what breaks systems. As you evolve, your life becomes more complex.
- Systems that once felt powerful start to feel constraining.
- Systems must be living frameworks, not monuments to the past.
- When a system begins to break, the first step is not to panic or power through.
