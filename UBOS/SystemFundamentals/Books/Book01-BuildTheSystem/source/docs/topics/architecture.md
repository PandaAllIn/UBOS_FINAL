# Architecture

## Chapter 1: Abundance Begins with Architecture
- If you're chasing abundance, chasing purpose, chasing a future you haven't yet lived, you must begin with architecture.
- Not the architecture of buildings, but the architecture of your thoughts, systems, and inner alignment.
- Noticing where your current architecture is leaking time, wasting energy, or working against the vision you claim to have.
- If your architecture doesn't answer these questions, you're not building, you're improvising.

## Chapter 12: Think in Layers, Not Leaps
- Every small effort becomes a contribution to the larger architecture.

## Chapter 20: Live Like a System Builder
- You stop being impressed by sudden breakthroughs and start being committed to the daily architecture of a well-designed life.
