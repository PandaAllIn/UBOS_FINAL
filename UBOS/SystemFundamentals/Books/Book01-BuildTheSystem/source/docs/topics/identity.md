# Identity

## Chapter 4: Identity Is the First System
- Every action you take, every habit you repeat, every goal you pursue is a reflection of one thing. your identity.
- But the truth is that no system can consistently outperform the identity it's built upon.
- Every time you show up with discipline, every time you speak from truth, every time you honor a commitment, you reinforce the identity of someone who builds systems that work.

## Chapter 9: Wealth Is a Byproduct of Alignment
- It begins by understanding who you are at your core, your values, your temperament, your vision, and designing systems that protect and express that identity.

## Chapter 10: Your Environment Is Part of the System
- But over time, the environment shapes your habits, your energy levels, your focus, and even your identity.

## Chapter 12: Think in Layers, Not Leaps
- Habits formed, identity shaped, priorities clarified, distractions removed.

## Chapter 14: Feedback Loops and Course Correction
- But feedback, when viewed through the lens of systems thinking, is never about your identity.

## Chapter 15: The System of Self-belief
- The reason many people fail to sustain change is because their systems are built on top of an old identity.
