# Alignment

## Chapter 1: Abundance Begins with Architecture
- Not the architecture of buildings, but the architecture of your thoughts, systems, and inner alignment.
- That alignment begins by asking the right questions.

## Chapter 4: Identity Is the First System
- The more you act in alignment with the version of yourself you are becoming, the more that version becomes real.

## Chapter 9: Wealth Is a Byproduct of Alignment
- It is created by building a system that reflects your truth and allows prosperity to grow as a natural result of alignment.
- If your systems are built around external validation, social pressure, or outdated goals, they will produce stress and misalignment.
- When you operate from alignment, you naturally create value.

## Chapter 10: Your Environment Is Part of the System
- It's either pulling you into alignment or pulling you into distraction.
