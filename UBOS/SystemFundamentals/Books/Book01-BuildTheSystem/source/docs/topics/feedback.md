# Feedback

## Chapter 14: Feedback Loops and Course Correction
- Every system, no matter how carefully designed, needs feedback.
- But feedback, when viewed through the lens of systems thinking, is never about your identity.
- The more honest and consistent the feedback, the stronger and more flexible your system becomes.
- There are two types of feedback every system needs.
- One of the most effective ways to implement feedback loops in your system is through regular review.

## Chapter 19: Build the System, Then Step Back
- You clarify the structure, refine the flow, create the automation, delegate the tasks, and build the feedback loops.
