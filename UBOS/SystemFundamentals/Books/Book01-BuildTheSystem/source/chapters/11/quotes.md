> Every week there's a new app, a new platform, a new productivity system, promising to change your life. It will speed up whatever system you already have in place. If your system is unclear or broken, the tool will amplify the chaos. If your system is welldesigned, the tool will enhance it. It's not the sophistication of the tool, it's the clarity of the system behind it. The core of any effective system is not the tool, but the process. They require discipline, reflection, and intentional design. A tool is only valuable when it serves a repeatable behavior that aligns with your system.
