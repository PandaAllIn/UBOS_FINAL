> The myth of hustle and the power of rhythm. The abundance mindset doesn't reject hard work, but it redefes its context. Rhythm is what converts energy into results without collapse. Rhythm asks, "How do I build something that works even when I'm not at my best?" Hustle never asks that question. True abundance can't exist without rhythm. Because abundance is a long game, and long games are one with systems, not sprints. People resist rhythm because it feels slower at first. But rhythm gives you something hustle never can.
