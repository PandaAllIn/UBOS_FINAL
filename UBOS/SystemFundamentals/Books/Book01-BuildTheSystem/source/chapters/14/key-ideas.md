# Key Ideas

- But feedback, when viewed through the lens of systems thinking, is never about your identity.
- Every system, no matter how carefully designed, needs feedback.
- It's how you feel, what you observe, the energy you bring, and the resistance you face.
- It's noticing that a routine is draining instead of energizing.
- It's realizing that a habit you once loved no longer fits the season you're in.
- One of the most effective ways to implement feedback loops in your system is through regular review.
- The more honest and consistent the feedback, the stronger and more flexible your system becomes.
- There are two types of feedback every system needs.
- This cycle repeated continuously allows your system to evolve in real time.
- Without a system for measuring and adjusting, even the most thoughtful plans become rigid.
