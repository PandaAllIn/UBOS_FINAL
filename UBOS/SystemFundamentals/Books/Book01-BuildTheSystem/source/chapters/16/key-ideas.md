# Key Ideas

- Energy is drained not from the work itself but from the weight of having to manage it all.
- It's about multiplying capacity, and building leverage into your system.
- Outsourcing tasks when things start to break down instead of designing support from the start.
- They treat it like a relief valve instead of a core system.
- When you delegate with clarity and intention, you're not just getting help.
- You become the system and the system becomes unsustainable.
- You can't hand off confusion and expect clarity in return.
- You wear exhaustion like a badge, forgetting that freedom was the reason you started building systems in the first place.
- You're building trust, developing people, and reinforcing your core systems. The key to effective delegation is systems. Without systems, delegation creates chaos.
- You're creating a structure where others can contribute meaningfully to a shared goal.
