- And if you're not willing to do this part, every system you try to build will feel hollow, misaligned, or forced.
- But building a system that actually works, a system that supports your vision of abundance, begins by getting radically clear about what you want and why it matters.
- It's about giving your life structure so your energy can flow in a meaningful direction.
- It's the real function of vision to direct your energy toward what's meaningful and away from what's simply available.
- That's the truth most people avoid because definition requires clarity and clarity requires slowing down.
- Their systems follow their vision, not the other way around.
- They're the ones who define their mission with such clarity that they can organize their lives around it.
- Too many people resist clarity because it requires commitment.
- Without it, even the best systems collapse under confusion.
- You can't build a system for a life you haven't imagined with clarity.
