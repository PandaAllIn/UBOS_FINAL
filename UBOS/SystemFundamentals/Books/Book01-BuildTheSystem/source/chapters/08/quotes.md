> There is a quiet power in systems that require one act of creation and then serve you again and again. Their days are filled with effort, but their systems produce nothing that outlives the moment. You spend energy once designing a habit that removes decision-making from your morning routine. They are not Instagrammable, but they are the bedrock of a systemized scalable life. To live in abundance, you must learn to shift from reacting to designing. When systems run in the background, your mental bandwidth is freed up for high leverage thinking and deep creative work. You've designed your environment and your routine so that good choices happen by default. It's important to understand that not every system has to be digital or complex.
