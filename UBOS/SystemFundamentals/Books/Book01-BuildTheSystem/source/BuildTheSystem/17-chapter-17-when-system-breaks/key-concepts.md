# Chapter 17: Key Concepts

## Core Concepts & Definitions

### üîß System Breakdown Types

#### Gradual Decay
**Pattern**: Slow degradation over time
**Causes**: Maintenance neglect, small compromises accumulating
**Symptoms**: Gradually declining quality, increasing effort for same results

#### Overload Collapse
**Pattern**: Sudden failure under increased demand
**Causes**: Scaling without system strengthening
**Symptoms**: Sudden inability to handle normal workload

#### Integration Failure
**Pattern**: Parts work individually but not together
**Causes**: Changes affecting system integration
**Symptoms**: Conflicts between system components

#### Environmental Mismatch
**Pattern**: System no longer fits circumstances
**Causes**: External changes making system obsolete
**Symptoms**: System fighting against new reality

### üîç Three-Level Diagnosis Framework

#### Level 1: Symptom Recognition
- Performance metrics declining
- Increased stress and frustration
- Quality issues appearing
- Time investment increasing
- Motivation dropping

#### Level 2: Root Cause Analysis
- Process breakdown identification
- Resource issue assessment
- Skill gap recognition
- Environmental factor analysis
- Design limitation discovery

#### Level 3: System Architecture Assessment
- Component performance analysis
- Integration effectiveness review
- Scalability capacity evaluation
- Resilience stress testing
- Evolution adaptation capability

### ‚ö° Emergency Stabilization Protocol

#### Immediate Response Steps:
1. **Stop the bleeding**: Halt damage-causing activities
2. **Stabilize core**: Ensure essential processes continue
3. **Assess damage**: Understand broken vs. working elements
4. **Temporary fixes**: Quick solutions for time
5. **Plan repair**: Design systematic restoration

#### Triage Principles:
- Critical first (core function threats)
- High impact (multiple area effects)
- Quick wins (easy immediate relief)
- Foundation focus (base before complexity)

### üîÑ Four-Phase Repair Methodology

#### Phase 1: System Archaeology
- Timeline reconstruction
- Change analysis
- Pattern identification
- Success archaeology

#### Phase 2: Repair Strategy
- Repair vs. rebuild decision
- Priority sequencing
- Resource requirement planning
- Risk assessment

#### Phase 3: Systematic Restoration
- Component repair
- Integration testing
- Stress testing
- Documentation update

#### Phase 4: Strengthening Prevention
- Weakness elimination
- Redundancy addition
- Monitoring enhancement
- Maintenance scheduling

### üèóÔ∏è Anti-Fragile System Design

#### Redundancy Elements:
- Backup processes for critical functions
- Skill diversification across team
- Resource buffers for unexpected demands
- Decision alternatives for important choices

#### Stress Inoculation:
- Controlled challenge testing
- Failure simulation practice
- Recovery procedure drilling
- Adaptation exercise rehearsal

#### Learning Integration:
- Systematic breakdown analysis
- Improvement implementation
- Knowledge documentation
- Wisdom sharing
