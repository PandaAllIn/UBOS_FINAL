# Chapter 16: Key Concepts

## Core Concepts & Definitions

### üìã System Delegation vs. Task Delegation
**Task Delegation**: Giving people work without context or support
**System Delegation**: Building capability for independent quality execution

**System Components**:
- Process documentation with clear procedures
- Training and development infrastructure
- Authority and accountability framework
- Support infrastructure for ongoing success

### üéØ Progressive Delegation Model

#### Stage 1: Shadowing (1-2 weeks)
- Observer role with expert execution
- Documentation review and study
- Small assistance with simple tasks
- Understanding verification

#### Stage 2: Supervised Execution (2-4 weeks)
- Guided practice with oversight
- Real-time feedback and correction
- Increasing independence gradually
- Problem-solving practice with support

#### Stage 3: Independent with Check-ins (4-8 weeks)
- Solo execution with scheduled reviews
- Problem escalation for joint solving
- Continuous improvement contributions

#### Stage 4: Full Independence (Ongoing)
- Autonomous operation and responsibility
- Performance reporting and communication
- Strategic input and process evolution
- Mentoring others in delegation chain

### üìã Delegation Readiness Assessment

#### Task Readiness:
- Documented process exists and tested
- Defined, measurable outcomes
- Appropriate complexity for skill level
- Resource clarity and availability
- Support accessibility when needed

#### Person Readiness:
- Skill match or development capability
- Motivation alignment and commitment
- Reliability track record
- Communication skills for updates/questions
- Growth mindset and learning willingness

#### System Readiness:
- Complete documentation available
- Training materials prepared
- Support structure active
- Feedback mechanisms established
- Quality assurance systems functioning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Delegation Failures

#### Inadequate Documentation
**Problem**: Unclear processes leading to constant questions
**Solution**: Thorough documentation before delegation

#### Insufficient Training
**Problem**: Expecting competence without development
**Solution**: Systematic skill building investment

#### Unclear Authority
**Problem**: Responsibility without corresponding power
**Solution**: Match authority level with responsibility

#### Micromanagement
**Problem**: Delegating tasks but not empowering execution
**Solution**: Define check-ins but resist constant oversight

#### Perfectionism
**Problem**: Taking back work due to different methods
**Solution**: Define "good enough" standards and maintain them
