description: Building a strong network requires clarity about desired connections,
  consistency (small, thoughtful, ongoing attention), and a mindset of reciprocity
  (giving value first and often) [1:28:13, 1:28:54, 1:29:31]. Leveraging the network
  involves connecting people to each other, strengthening the web without direct personal
  involvement in every interaction [1:30:08, 1:30:15].
