one_liner: Networks are treated as dynamic ecosystems of value exchange through which
  opportunities travel [1:27:00, 1:27:23].
description: Networks are treated as dynamic ecosystems of value exchange through
  which opportunities travel [1:27:00, 1:27:23]. Building a strong network requires
  clarity about desired connections, consistency (small, thoughtful, ongoing attention),
  and a mindset of reciprocity (giving value first and often) [1:28:13, 1:28:54, 1:29:31].
