title: Turning Networks into Growth Engines
summary: Networks are treated as dynamic ecosystems of value exchange through which
  opportunities travel [1:27:00, 1:27:23]. Building a strong network requires clarity
  about desired connections, consistency (small, thoughtful, ongoing attention), and
  a mindset of reciprocity (giving value first and often) [1:28:13, 1:28:54, 1:29:31].
  Leveraging the network involves connecting people to each other, strengthening the
  web without direct personal involvement in every interaction [1:30:08, 1:30:15].
  The goal is a network anchored in trust and clarity about one's identity, which
  eventually becomes self-sustaining and attracts opportunities [1:31:49, 1:33:06].
objectives:
- View networks as strategic assets, not passive connections.
- Design systems that keep relationships reciprocal and purposeful.
- Integrate contribution into network rhythms to compound trust.
