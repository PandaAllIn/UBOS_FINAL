title: Why Goals Alone Fail and What to Build Instead
summary: Goals are described as incomplete because they define what you want but not
  how you will consistently get it. Relying on goals alone makes success temporary
  and dependent on unreliable willpower. A  system is defined as a repeatable process
  that produces a predictable result, operating regardless of daily feelings. Systems
  shift the focus from the outcome to the process that creates the outcome. Goals
  should serve as signposts, while the system is the true engine of movement. Building
  systems creates freedom by removing the constant mental burden of daily decisions
  and makes desired outcomes inevitable.
objectives:
- Explain why outcomes collapse without a repeatable supporting system.
- Shift focus from goal chasing to process design.
