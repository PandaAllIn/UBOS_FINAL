title: Failsafe Systems for Tough Seasons
summary: "Failsafe systems are resilient, stripped-down versions of routines, built\
  \ in advance as an \"emergency mode\" to survive disruptions (illness, strain) [1:35:01,\
  \ 1:36:01]. These systems focus on non-negotiables\u2014the minimum actions needed\
  \ to prevent major regression [1:36:22]. The strategy involves redefining success\
  \ for the season (showing up for the basics, not peak performance) [1:37:06], reducing\
  \ decision fatigue [1:37:43], and utilizing a reduced scope (e.g., writing 100 words\
  \ instead of 1,000) to ensure the chain of action is never entirely broken [1:39:27,\
  \ 1:39:46]."
objectives:
- Architect fail-safes that keep systems operational during disruption.
- Define reduced modes and safety nets before crises arrive.
- Test resilience plans so they activate without hesitation.
