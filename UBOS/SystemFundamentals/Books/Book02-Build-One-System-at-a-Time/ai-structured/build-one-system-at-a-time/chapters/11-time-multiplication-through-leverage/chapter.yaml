title: Time Multiplication Through Leverage
summary: 'Leverage allows one to multiply the impact of their time so that effort
  produces far more results, often independently [1:19:57, 1:20:03]. The three most
  powerful forms are: 1. Automation: Using tools or processes to handle repetitive
  tasks without constant input [1:20:32]. 2. Delegation: Entrusting tasks to others
  to free up personal time for high-return work [1:20:44, 1:21:52]. 3.'
objectives:
- Differentiate between spending time and multiplying time with leverage.
- Apply automation, delegation, and elimination to reclaim capacity.
- "Map leverage plays to the system\u2019s maturity curve."
