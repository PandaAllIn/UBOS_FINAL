title: Growth Inevitably Leads To Systems Becoming Restrictive Or Irrelevant
one_liner: Growth inevitably leads to systems becoming restrictive or irrelevant,

description: Growth inevitably leads to systems becoming restrictive or irrelevant,
  often signaled by diminishing returns or increased friction (procrastination, working
  around the system) [1:42:10, 1:43:15, 1:43:52]. Outgrowing a system is a sign of
  success, not failure [1:42:38].
