title: Breaking and Rebuilding Systems When You Outgrow Them
summary: Growth inevitably leads to systems becoming restrictive or irrelevant, often
  signaled by diminishing returns or increased friction (procrastination, working
  around the system) [1:42:10, 1:43:15, 1:43:52]. Outgrowing a system is a sign of
  success, not failure [1:42:38]. Rebuilding requires courage, analyzing what parts
  are still useful, and redesigning the structure based on current and future needs,
  incorporating greater leverage and scalability [1:44:21, 1:44:58, 1:45:35]. The
  ability to break and rebuild systems is a mark of adaptability, ensuring systems
  grow with the individual [1:47:34, 1:47:54].
objectives:
- Recognize signals that a system has been outgrown.
- Design upgrade loops that rebuild without losing momentum.
- Document post-mortems to inform the next iteration.
