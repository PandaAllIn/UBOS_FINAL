title: Your Future Is a Living System
summary: The future is described as a living, constantly shaped, and adaptive system,
  not a fixed point [1:56:06, 1:56:19]. Designing for a living future requires adaptability
  to unexpected setbacks and opportunities [1:57:19, 1:58:03]. Maintaining it requires
  regular evaluation to ensure systems still align with current goals and values [1:58:28].
  Flexibility allows the individual to adjust their destination without losing momentum
  [1:59:22]. This mindset frees one from the pressure of perfect planning, allowing
  them to shape an adaptable, abundant life [2:01:44, 2:01:55].
objectives:
- Treat the future as a living system under active construction.
- Use scenario design to test resilience of long-term plans.
- Anchor daily actions in the identity of the future builder.
