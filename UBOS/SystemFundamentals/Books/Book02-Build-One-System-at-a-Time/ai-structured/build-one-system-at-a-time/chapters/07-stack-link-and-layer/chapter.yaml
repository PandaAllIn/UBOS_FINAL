title: Stack, Link, and Layer
summary: This chapter shows how to combine individual systems to multiply their results
  [50:57, 51:17]. Stacking means the output of one system becomes the input for the
  next (e.g., fitness boosting productivity). Linking creates direct connections where
  one action automatically triggers the next (e.g., finishing a workout triggers journaling).
  Layering means running multiple supportive systems in parallel for synergy (e.g.,
  learning and networking systems). This integration creates a self-reinforcing network
  that leads to exponential growth and increased resilience.
objectives:
- Link systems so energy and insight compound across domains.
- Identify hinge habits that can be stacked for leverage.
- Draft rhythm maps that keep linked systems synchronized.
