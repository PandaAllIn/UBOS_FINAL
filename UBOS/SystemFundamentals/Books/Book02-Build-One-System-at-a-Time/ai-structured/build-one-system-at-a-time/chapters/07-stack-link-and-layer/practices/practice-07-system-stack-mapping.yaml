title: System Stack Mapping
prompt: Link complementary systems so they compound energy and output.
steps:
- List current systems and note the trigger that begins each one.
- "Highlight natural handoffs where one system\u2019s output feeds another\u2019s\
  \ input."
- Design a daily or weekly rhythm map that orders systems for the least friction.
- Pilot the sequence and adjust timing until the stack feels fluid and sustainable.
expected_outcome: An integrated rhythm that chains key systems together for compounding
  momentum.
topics:
- integration
- rhythm
- system
