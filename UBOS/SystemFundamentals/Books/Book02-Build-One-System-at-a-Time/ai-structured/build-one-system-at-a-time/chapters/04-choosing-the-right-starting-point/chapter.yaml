title: Choosing the Right Starting Point
summary: 'Instead of trying to fix everything at once, this chapter advises beginning
  with one carefully chosen, high-leverage system that will produce ripple effects
  across multiple life aspects (e.g., health or finances). Strategic considerations
  include: urgency (addressing severe pain points, balanced with achievability), confidence
  (choosing an area where early wins build belief), and alignment with the long-term
  vision. The starting point must be clearly defined (e.g., specifying "health" as
  "improving sleep") and matched to the current season of life or capacity.'
objectives:
- Evaluate potential starting points by impact, confidence, and alignment.
- Select one high-leverage system that unlocks cascading benefits.
- Translate vision into a clear system definition for the current season.
