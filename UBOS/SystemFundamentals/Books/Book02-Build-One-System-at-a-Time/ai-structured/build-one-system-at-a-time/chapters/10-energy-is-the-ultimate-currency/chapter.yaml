title: Energy Is the Ultimate Currency
summary: 'Energy is the foundational resource on which all systems depend; it determines
  consistency, focus, and resilience [1:12:20, 1:12:51]. Protecting and building energy
  multiplies the value of time [1:13:09, 1:13:15]. Energy is managed across four sources:
  1. Physical: Through nutrition, movement, sleep, and overall health [1:13:41]. 2.
  Mental: Capacity for focus, protected by reducing unnecessary decisions and distractions
  [1:14:17].'
objectives:
- Manage four dimensions of energy as the currency of systems.
- Diagnose leaks in physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy.
- Design replenishment rituals that stabilize performance.
