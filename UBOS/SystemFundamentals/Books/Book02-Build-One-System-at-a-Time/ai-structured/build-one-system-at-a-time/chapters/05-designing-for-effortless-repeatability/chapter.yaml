title: Designing for Effortless Repeatability
summary: "A system\u2019s success depends on its ability to be repeated consistently,\
  \ making the desired action easier to do than to avoid [36:25, 36:44]. This is achieved\
  \ through simplicity (using the smallest working version); automation (removing\
  \ the need for daily willpower by scheduling or prepping the environment); and triggers\
  \ (cues that turn the system into a reflex). Other elements include reducing variability\
  \ so the system functions under a wide range of conditions, and building in a reduced\
  \ version to use on difficult days to prevent breaking the chain entirely."
objectives:
- Engineer routines for effortless repeatability instead of heroic effort.
- Use triggers, automation, and friction removal to stabilize execution.
- Build resilient systems that work on hard days as well as ideal ones.
