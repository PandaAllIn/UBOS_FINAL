description: "A system\u2019s success depends on its ability to be repeated consistently,\
  \ making the desired action easier to do than to avoid [36:25, 36:44]. This is achieved\
  \ through simplicity (using the smallest working version); automation (removing\
  \ the need for daily willpower by scheduling or prepping the environment); and triggers\
  \ (cues that turn the system into a reflex)."
