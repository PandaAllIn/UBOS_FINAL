description: This is achieved through simplicity (using the smallest working version);
  automation (removing the need for daily willpower by scheduling or prepping the
  environment); and triggers (cues that turn the system into a reflex). Other elements
  include reducing variability so the system functions under a wide range of conditions,
  and building in a reduced version to use on difficult days to prevent breaking the
  chain entirely.
