title: A Keystone System Is One That
one_liner: A keystone system is one that, when strengthened, improves multiple other
  systems simultaneously, acting as a force multiplier and holding the overall structure
  together [1:05:13, 1:05:33, 1:05:45].
description: A keystone system is one that, when strengthened, improves multiple other
  systems simultaneously, acting as a force multiplier and holding the overall structure
  together [1:05:13, 1:05:33, 1:05:45]. Keystone systems produce a ripple effect,
  amplify other systems' effectiveness, and can stabilize momentum during disruptions.
