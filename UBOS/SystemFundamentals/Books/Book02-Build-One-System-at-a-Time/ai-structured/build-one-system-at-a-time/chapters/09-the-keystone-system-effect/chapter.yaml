title: The Keystone System Effect
summary: A keystone system is one that, when strengthened, improves multiple other
  systems simultaneously, acting as a force multiplier and holding the overall structure
  together [1:05:13, 1:05:33, 1:05:45]. Keystone systems produce a ripple effect,
  amplify other systems' effectiveness, and can stabilize momentum during disruptions.
  Examples include health (provides physical energy for all other systems), time management
  (creates operational space), and financial systems (provides resources and stability).
  Identifying and prioritizing the keystone system ensures focused investment for
  the highest return.
objectives:
- Pinpoint the keystone system that amplifies multiple results.
- Score systems by breadth of impact and ease of maintenance.
- Sequence supporting systems around the keystone for momentum.
