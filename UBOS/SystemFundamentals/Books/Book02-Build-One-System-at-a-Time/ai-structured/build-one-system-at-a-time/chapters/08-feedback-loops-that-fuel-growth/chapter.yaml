title: Feedback Loops that Fuel Growth
summary: "Since systems are never truly finished, feedback loops allow systems to\
  \ evolve and self-improve over time [58:11, 58:50]. Feedback is simply information\u2014\
  a tool for growth [59:02]. Systems require two types of feedback: outcome feedback\
  \ (measuring final results, like savings accumulated) and process feedback (measuring\
  \ execution consistency, like skipping review sessions). Regular check-ins, tracking,\
  \ and seeking external perspectives are key methods. Feedback should guide improvements\
  \ that make the system easier and more reliable, ensuring it is adaptable and aligned\
  \ with needs."
objectives:
- Construct feedback loops that inform both outcomes and process.
- Distinguish between momentum signals and warning indicators.
- Schedule reviews that translate data into actionable refinements.
