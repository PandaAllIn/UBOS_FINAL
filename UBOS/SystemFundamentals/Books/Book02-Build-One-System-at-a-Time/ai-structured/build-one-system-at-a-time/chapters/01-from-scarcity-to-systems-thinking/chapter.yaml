title: From Scarcity to Systems Thinking
summary: This chapter focuses on the fundamental shift in mindset required before
  building effective systems. Scarcity thinking views the world as a place of limitation,
  resulting in defensive systems built to protect against loss, which leads to comparison,
  fear, and hesitation. Abundance thinking views the world as fluid and expansive,
  prompting the creation of systems that generate more opportunities, resources, and
  freedom. Systems thinking means relying on consistent structures that operate whether
  you feel inspired or not, making the right actions easier than the wrong ones. Success
  is measured by the quality of your systems, not solely by outcomes.
objectives:
- Identify how scarcity thinking reinforces defensive routines and hesitation.
- Describe how abundance thinking widens opportunities through design.
- Adopt systems thinking as the metric for sustainable results.
