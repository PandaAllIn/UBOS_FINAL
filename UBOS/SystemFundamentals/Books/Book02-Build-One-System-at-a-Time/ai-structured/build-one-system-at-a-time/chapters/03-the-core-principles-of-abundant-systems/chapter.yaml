title: The Core Principles of Abundant Systems
summary: 'This chapter outlines the ten essential principles for building transformative
  and lasting systems [23, 20:56]: 1. Clarity of Purpose: Systems must align with
  a long-term vision, not just avoid immediate problems. 2. Sustainability: Systems
  must be maintainable even on your worst days, integrating smoothly into life; starting
  small is a sign of wisdom. 3. Leverage: Systems should create results greater than
  the effort put in, utilizing technology, relationships, or skills to multiply impact.'
objectives:
- Internalize the ten principles that define abundant systems.
- Assess a system against sustainability, leverage, and feedback.
