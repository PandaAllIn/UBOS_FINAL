title: The Scarcity Trap in Disguise
summary: 'This chapter warns that scarcity thinking can subtly undermine abundant
  systems by disguising itself as productive behavior [1:49:04]. Disguised traps include:    Overoptimization:
  Shifting from healthy improvement to fear-driven control [1:49:40]. Hoarding Resources:
  Holding back time or money out of fear of running out, leading to stagnation [1:50:22].
  Excessive Competition: Pushing systems harder to outpace others, driven by comparison
  [1:50:57]. Perfectionism: Delaying action due to the fear that anything less than
  perfect will lead to failure [1:51:36]. Overcommitment: Saying yes to everything
  out of fear that opportunities are rare [1:52:09].'
objectives:
- Detect scarcity traps disguised as productivity or success.
- Challenge scripts that push reactive, fear-driven behaviour.
- Replace hidden scarcity reflexes with abundance-based responses.
