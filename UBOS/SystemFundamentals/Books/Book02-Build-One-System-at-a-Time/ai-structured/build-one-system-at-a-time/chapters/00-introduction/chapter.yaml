title: Introduction
summary: The Introduction establishes that transformation requires intentional design
  and is engineered piece by piece through a series of systems. Behind every success
  story is a system quietly converting vision into daily action. It critiques the
  use of one-off goals, which cause energy to fade and lead to cycles of chasing outcomes
  without building the necessary underlying machinery. The book introduces the shift
  from scarcity thinking (fear-based, protective) to abundance thinking (creation-based,
  expansive) and advocates for building one high-leverage system at a time, preventing
  overwhelm and accelerating growth.
objectives:
- Recognize that durable transformation is built by deliberate systems, not one-off
  goals.
- Differentiate scarcity defences from abundance-driven creation.
- Commit to sequencing growth through one high-leverage system at a time.
