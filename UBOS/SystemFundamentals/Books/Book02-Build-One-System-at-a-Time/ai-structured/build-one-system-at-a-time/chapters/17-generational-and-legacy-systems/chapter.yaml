title: Generational and Legacy Systems
summary: This chapter addresses building systems that outlast the individual, such
  as financial frameworks, educational processes, or organizational models, to create
  enduring impact [2:02:34, 2:03:09]. Key elements include documentation (writing
  down processes for others to replicate and adapt) [2:04:15, 2:04:33], resilience
  (adaptability to different people and eras) [2:04:45], and clear values (acting
  as a compass to maintain the system's original purpose) [2:05:18, 2:05:29]. Building
  with legacy in mind shifts the focus from immediate results to lasting influence
  and ensures the impact continues to unfold long after one's own chapter is complete
  [2:07:50, 2:08:34].
objectives:
- Extend systems thinking to generational impact and stewardship.
- Define what legacy-quality systems look like in practice.
- Create governance rhythms that keep successors empowered.
