title: Key Elements Include Documentation (Writing Down Processes For Others To Replicate
  And Adapt) [2
one_liner: Key elements include documentation (writing down processes for others to
  replicate and adapt) [2:04:15, 2:04:33], resilience (adaptability to different people
  and eras) [2:04:45], and clear values (acting as a compass to maintain the system's
  original purpose) [2:05:18, 2:05:29].
description: Key elements include documentation (writing down processes for others
  to replicate and adapt) [2:04:15, 2:04:33], resilience (adaptability to different
  people and eras) [2:04:45], and clear values (acting as a compass to maintain the
  system's original purpose) [2:05:18, 2:05:29]. Building with legacy in mind shifts
  the focus from immediate results to lasting influence and ensures the impact continues
  to unfold long after one's own chapter is complete [2:07:50, 2:08:34].
