title: Systems for Contribution and Impact
summary: The ultimate measure of life is found in what is created for others [2:09:14].
  Contribution systems structure generosity (time, resources, knowledge) to make it
  consistent, sustainable, and far-reaching, rather than spontaneous [2:09:59, 2:10:05].
  Contribution should be intentional, focused on where unique skills can have the
  greatest effect [2:10:23]. Methods (financial, skill-based, relational) must be
  sustainable and integrated into regular life [2:11:02, 2:12:06]. The systems should
  be measurable for improvement and driven by purpose and values, not recognition
  [2:12:21, 2:13:48].
objectives:
- Align personal systems with contribution and service.
- Design impact loops that deliver value to others reliably.
- Measure contribution alongside personal metrics of success.
