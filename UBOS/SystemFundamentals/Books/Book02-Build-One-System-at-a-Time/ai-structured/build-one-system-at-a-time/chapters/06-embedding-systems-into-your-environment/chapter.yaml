title: Embedding Systems into Your Environment
summary: This chapter explains that a system is much stronger when supported by the
  physical and digital environment [43:34, 46:57]. Environmental design shifts responsibility
  from the mind to the surroundings, acting as an autopilot [44:33]. Strategies include
  identifying physical supports (e.g., readying tools in the workspace) [44:40], removing
  conflicting triggers (e.g., moving a phone away during deep work), using visual
  cues (e.g., a checklist), and ensuring the social environment (people) reinforces
  the process.
objectives:
- Recognize environment as silent architecture shaping behaviour.
- Audit physical, digital, and social spaces for alignment with systems.
- Deliberately embed cues that keep priority work on autopilot.
