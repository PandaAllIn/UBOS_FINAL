# Build One System at a Time – Structuring Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Orientation (COMPLETE)
- Manuscript reviewed in `source/Build_One_System_at_A_Time.md`.
- Chapter breakdown (Introduction + 19) confirmed.
- Topic vocabulary aligned with the shared UBOS schema.

## Phase 1 — Pipeline Design (COMPLETE)
**Owner:** Library Architect
- `tools/parse_book.py` rebuilt to ingest curated `source/chapters/*` assets and emit polished chapter summaries, ideas, practices, and quotes.
- Topic mapping re-used Book 01 taxonomy with additions (leverage, network, legacy).
- Practice prompts and objectives centralized in code for deterministic regeneration.

## Phase 2 — Chapter Generation (COMPLETE)
**Owner:** Library Architect → SpecsAgent
- Regenerated chapters 00–19 with consistent objectives, ideas, practices, and quotes.
- Validation scripts executed after regeneration to guarantee schema compliance.

## Phase 3 — Aggregation & Exports (COMPLETE)
**Owner:** Library Architect / SpecsAgent
- `build_aggregates.py` refreshed JSONL datasets in `chapters/all/`.
- `export_for_agents.py` updated quick-reference bundles for downstream agents.

## Phase 4 — Quality Review (ONGOING)
**Owner:** Library Architect + Review Agent
- Spot checks completed on regenerated chapters; continue monitoring for refinements.
- Topic vocabulary updates routed through the shared schema when new themes emerge.

## Phase 5 — Handoff (READY)
**Owner:** SpecsAgent
- `SPECKIT_HANDOFF.md` references the refreshed tooling; reruns are deterministic (`python3 tools/parse_book.py`).
- Aggregates ready for integration into cross-book analytics workflows.
