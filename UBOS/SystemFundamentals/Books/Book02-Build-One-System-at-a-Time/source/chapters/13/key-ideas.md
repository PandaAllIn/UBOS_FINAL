# Key Ideas

- Failsafe systems are resilient, stripped-down versions of routines, built in advance as an "emergency mode" to survive disruptions (illness, strain) [1:35:01, 1:36:01].
- Failsafe systems are resilient, stripped-down versions of routines, built in advance as an "emergency mode" to survive disruptions (illness, strain) [1:35:01, 1:36:01]. These systems focus on **non-negotiables**â€”the minimum actions needed to prevent major regression [1:36:22]. The strategy involves redefining success for the season (showing up for the basics, not peak performance) [1:37:06], reducing decision fatigue [1:37:43], and utilizing a reduced scope (e.g., writing 100 words instead of 1,000) to ensure the chain of action is never entirely broken [1:39:27, 1:39:46].
