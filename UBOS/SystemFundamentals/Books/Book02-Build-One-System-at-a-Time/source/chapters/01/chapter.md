# Chapter 01 â€“ From scarcity to systems thinking

This chapter focuses on the fundamental shift in mindset required before building effective systems. **Scarcity thinking** views the world as a place of limitation, resulting in defensive systems built to protect against loss, which leads to comparison, fear, and hesitation. **Abundance thinking** views the world as fluid and expansive, prompting the creation of systems that generate more opportunities, resources, and freedom. Systems thinking means relying on consistent structures that operate whether you feel inspired or not, making the right actions easier than the wrong ones. Success is measured by the **quality of your systems**, not solely by outcomes.
