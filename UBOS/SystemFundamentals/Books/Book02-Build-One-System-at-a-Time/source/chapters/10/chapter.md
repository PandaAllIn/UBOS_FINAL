# Chapter 10 â€“ Energy is the ultimate currency

Energy is the foundational resource on which all systems depend; it determines consistency, focus, and resilience [1:12:20, 1:12:51]. Protecting and building energy multiplies the value of time [1:13:09, 1:13:15]. Energy is managed across four sources: 1.  **Physical:** Through nutrition, movement, sleep, and overall health [1:13:41]. 2.  **Mental:** Capacity for focus, protected by reducing unnecessary decisions and distractions [1:14:17]. 3.  **Emotional:** Motivation and resilience, maintained by setting boundaries and spending time on fulfilling activities [1:14:50, 1:15:04]. 4.  **Spiritual/Alignment:** Energy derived from meaning and living in harmony with purpose and values [1:15:36]. Effective energy management involves aligning demanding work with natural energy peaks and incorporating planned recovery periods [1:16:47, 1:17:19].
