# Chapter 04 â€“ Choosing the right starting point

Instead of trying to fix everything at once, this chapter advises beginning with one carefully chosen, **high-leverage** system that will produce ripple effects across multiple life aspects (e.g., health or finances). Strategic considerations include: **urgency** (addressing severe pain points, balanced with achievability), **confidence** (choosing an area where early wins build belief), and **alignment** with the long-term vision. The starting point must be clearly defined (e.g., specifying "health" as "improving sleep") and matched to the current season of life or capacity.
