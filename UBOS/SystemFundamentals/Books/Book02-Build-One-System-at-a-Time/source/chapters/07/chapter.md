# Chapter 07 â€“ Stack, link, and layer

This chapter shows how to combine individual systems to multiply their results [50:57, 51:17]. *   **Stacking** means the output of one system becomes the input for the next (e.g., fitness boosting productivity). *   **Linking** creates direct connections where one action automatically triggers the next (e.g., finishing a workout triggers journaling). *   **Layering** means running multiple supportive systems in parallel for synergy (e.g., learning and networking systems). This integration creates a self-reinforcing network that leads to exponential growth and increased resilience.
