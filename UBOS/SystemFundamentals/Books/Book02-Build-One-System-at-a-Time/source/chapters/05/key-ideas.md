# Key Ideas

- A system’s success depends on its ability to be repeated consistently, making the desired action easier to do than to avoid [36:25, 36:44].
- A system’s success depends on its ability to be repeated consistently, making the desired action easier to do than to avoid [36:25, 36:44]. This is achieved through **simplicity** (using the smallest working version); **automation** (removing the need for daily willpower by scheduling or prepping the environment); and **triggers** (cues that turn the system into a reflex). Other elements include reducing **variability** so the system functions under a wide range of conditions, and building in a **reduced version** to use on difficult days to prevent breaking the chain entirely.
