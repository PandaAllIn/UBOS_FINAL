- Goals are described as incomplete because they define *what* you want but not *how* you will consistently get it. Relying on goals alone makes success temporary and dependent on unreliable willpower. A ** system** is defined as a repeatable process that produces a predictable result, operating regardless of daily feelings. Systems shift the focus from the outcome to the **process** that creates the outcome. Goals should serve as signposts, while the system is the true engine of movement. Building systems creates freedom by removing the constant mental burden of daily decisions and makes desired outcomes inevitable.
