title: Win the Micro-Battles
summary: Win the Micro-Battles people lose the war because they ignore the daily battles.
  If life is a battlefield, the biggest mistake you can make is thinking the war is
  won in one single heroic moment. It's not. It's won in the early mornings when you
  get up instead of hitting snooze. In the quiet decision to finish a task when no
  one's watching. In the moment you choose to read a page, take a walk, ask a better
  question, or delay that impulsive reaction.
objectives:
- Win micro-battles that compound into momentum.
- Deploy discipline on daily decisions.
- Stack small wins to stay mission-ready.
