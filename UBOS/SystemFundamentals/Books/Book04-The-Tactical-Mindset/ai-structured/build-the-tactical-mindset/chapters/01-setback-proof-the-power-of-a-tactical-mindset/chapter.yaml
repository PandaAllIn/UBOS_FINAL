summary: Setback-Proof - The Power of a Tactical Mindset a tactical mindset. The true
  test of a person's strength isn't how they act when things go right. It's how they
  respond when everything goes wrong. Life isn't a straight shot. It's a series of
  unexpected turns, late night calls, rejections, delays, lost chances, and sudden
  storms. You've seen it.
objectives:
- Respond instead of react when adversity hits.
- Build emotional control that keeps decisions sharp.
- Choose next moves deliberately even when momentum stalls.
