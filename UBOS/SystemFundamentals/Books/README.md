# Foundational Books

Each subdirectory captures a foundational text that powers UBOS. Books follow a consistent layout:

- `source/` — unmodified manuscripts and supporting materials.
- `ai-structured/` — machine-friendly breakdowns that adhere to the global schema.

New volumes should be added sequentially (`Book02-...`, `Book03-...`) to preserve ordering.
