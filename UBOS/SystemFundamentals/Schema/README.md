# Schema & Templates

This directory defines the shared schema for AI-ready knowledge assets.

Contents:
- `SCHEMA.md` — field definitions, naming rules, and validation requirements.
- `templates/` — canonical YAML skeletons for chapters, ideas, practices, and quotes.

All books under `Books/` must conform to this schema. Update this directory before changing any downstream files.
