# Templates

YAML skeletons for AI-ready assets. Copy these into a book's `ai-structured/<book-short-name>/` folder when creating new records.

- `chapter.yaml` — chapter metadata.
- `idea.yaml` — principle/metaphor records.
- `practice.yaml` — exercises, checklists, rituals.
- `quote.yaml` — attributed quotations.

Always conform to `../SCHEMA.md` when extending or modifying templates.
