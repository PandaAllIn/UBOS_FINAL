# System Fundamentals

System Fundamentals hosts the canonical knowledge assets UBOS agents rely on.

Structure:
- `Schema/` — shared definitions, templates, and validation rules for AI-ready content.
- `Books/` — each foundational book captured as both raw sources and AI-structured derivatives.

Follow the documented workflow in each book directory to extend the system or add new volumes.
