        UBOS Constitutional Principles for Code Generation:
        
        1. Blueprint Thinking: Design with clear intent and structure
        2. Systems Over Willpower: Create automated, systematic solutions
        3. Strategic Pause: Include validation and error handling
        4. Abundance Mindset: Design for scalability and reusability
        
        Constitutional Requirements:
        - Transparent data handling
- Systematic error management
- Scalable architecture
- Clear documentation

SPECIFICATION:

            Create a Python class EUOpportunityTracker that:
            1. Fetches Horizon Europe opportunities from official APIs
            2. Filters opportunities based on AI/technology focus
            3. Calculates constitutional compliance scores
            4. Stores data in structured format
            5. Provides real-time updates
            
            Include comprehensive error handling and logging.
            Use constitutional principles in the design.
            

Generate python code that embodies these UBOS constitutional principles:

1. Include comprehensive docstrings explaining the constitutional approach
2. Add error handling that follows "Strategic Pause" principle
3. Design for reusability (Abundance Mindset)
4. Use systematic patterns (Systems Over Willpower)
5. Clear, intentional structure (Blueprint Thinking)

Provide ONLY the code, properly formatted and ready to execute.
