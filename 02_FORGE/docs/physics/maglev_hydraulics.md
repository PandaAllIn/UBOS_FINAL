# Mag‑Lev & Pneumatic Tube Mechanics (Design Metaphor)

## Mag‑Lev Physics (Metaphor)
- Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) and electrodynamic suspension (EDS) achieve frictionless guidance; stability requires feedback control of gap.
- Energy: drag from eddy currents and air; minimized by streamlined profiles.

## Pneumatic Transport (Puck Tubes)
- Flow governed by Bernoulli and Darcy‑Weisbach; pressure ∆P ∝ (L/D)·f·(ρV²/2).
- Valve logic maps to sanctuary checks and schema validation stages.

## Mapping to Rails
- Rails = message buses; Pucks = validated, schema‑typed payloads; Valves = validators/approvals; Governors = rate limits.
