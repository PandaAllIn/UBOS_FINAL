    "summary": "The warnings you are seeing indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error.",
    "content": "The warnings you are seeing indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error. This means the files either do not exist at those locations, have been moved, or the repository structure has changed.\n\nHere are several **mitigations and best practices** to address and prevent such issues in the future:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify the URLs and Repository Structure**\n- **Action:** Double-check the URLs and ensure the files actually exist at the specified paths.\n- **How:** Visit the URLs directly in your browser:\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n- **Mitigation:** If the files are missing, check the repository’s main branch or other branches for the correct file names or locations. The files may have been renamed, moved, or deleted.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Handle 404 Errors Gracefully in Code**\n- **Action:** Implement error handling in your code to catch 404 errors and provide a fallback or user-friendly message.\n- **Example (Python):**\n  ```python\n  import requests\n\n  def fetch_json(url, fallback_data):\n      try:\n          response = requests.get(url)\n          response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses\n          return response.json()\n      except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n          if e.response.status_code == 404:\n              print(f\"File not found at {url}, using fallback data.\")\n              return fallback_data\n          else:\n              raise e\n      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n          print(f\"Error fetching {url}: {e}, using fallback data.\")\n          return fallback_data\n\n  # Usage\n  horizon_data = fetch_json(\n      \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\",\n      {\"fallback\": \"horizon_sample\"}\n  )\n  erdf_data = fetch_json(\n      \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\",\n      {\"fallback\": \"erdf_sample\"}\n  )\n  ```\n- **Mitigation:** This ensures your application continues to work even if the remote files are unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check for Repository or Branch Changes**\n- **Action:** Verify if the repository has changed its default branch (e.g., from `main` to `master` or vice versa).\n- **How:** Check the repository’s default branch on GitHub.\n- **Mitigation:** Update your URLs to reflect the correct branch if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monitor for Repository Updates**\n- **Action:** Subscribe to repository updates or set up a webhook to be notified of changes.\n- **Mitigation:** This helps you stay informed about any changes that might affect your application.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Cache or Mirror Critical Files Locally**\n- **Action:** Download and store critical files locally or in a reliable cloud storage service.\n- **Mitigation:** This reduces dependency on external repositories and ensures availability even if the remote files are removed or moved.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Document and Communicate Dependencies**\n- **Action:** Document all external dependencies and their URLs in your project’s README or documentation.\n- **Mitigation:** This helps other developers understand and troubleshoot issues related to missing files.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Use Versioned URLs or Tags**\n- **Action:** If the repository supports it, use versioned URLs or tags to ensure you are fetching a specific, stable version of the file.\n- **Mitigation:** This prevents issues caused by changes in the main branch.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Contact the Repository Maintainers**\n- **Action:** If the files are critical and you cannot find them, reach out to the repository maintainers for assistance.\n- **Mitigation:** They may be able to provide the correct URLs or restore the files.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Automate Health Checks**\n- **Action:** Set up automated health checks or monitoring for your application’s dependencies.\n- **Mitigation:** This helps you quickly identify and address issues before they impact users.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Fallback to Sample Data**\n- **Action:** As you are already doing, fall back to sample data when remote fetch fails.\n- **Mitigation:** Ensure the sample data is up-to-date and representative of the expected structure.\n\n---\n\nBy implementing these mitigations, you can make your application more resilient to 404 errors and ensure a better user experience even when external resources are unavailable.",
