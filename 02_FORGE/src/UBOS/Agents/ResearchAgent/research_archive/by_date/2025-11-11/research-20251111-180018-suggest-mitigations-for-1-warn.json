Here are targeted mitigations for this issue:\n\n## Verify File Existence and Paths\n\n**Check that the files actually exist** in the repository at the expected locations. Navigate to the ubos-ai/datasets repository on GitHub and confirm that `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` are present in the main branch's root directory. Verify the exact file paths match what's specified in your URLs—even a single character difference will cause a 404 error.[2]\n\n**Ensure case sensitivity is correct.** GitHub Pages and raw content servers are case-sensitive, so `Horizon_Sample.json` would not match `horizon_sample.json`.[4] Check that your filenames use the exact casing as they appear in the repository.\n\n## Confirm Repository Accessibility\n\n**Verify the repository is public.** If the ubos-ai/datasets repository is private, the raw content URLs will return 404 errors. GitHub Pages and raw content hosting require public repositories to be accessible.[5] Check the repository settings to ensure it's set to public visibility.\n\n**Check GitHub's status page** to rule out any service incidents that might temporarily affect raw content delivery.[1]\n\n## Address Caching and Deployment Issues\n\n**Clear your browser cache or test in an incognito window** if you're verifying the URLs directly in a browser, as cached 404 responses can persist.[1][7]\n\n**Verify the repository has been properly committed and pushed.** Ensure that the latest changes containing these JSON files have been committed to the main branch and pushed to GitHub. Sometimes the issue stems from uncommitted or unpushed changes.[2]\n\n**Check the repository's build logs** by navigating to the \"Actions\" tab in the GitHub repository to see if there are any deployment or build issues preventing the files from being accessible.[2]\n\n## Implement Fallback Strategies\n\nSince your application is already falling back to samples when remote fetch fails, consider **implementing retry logic with exponential backoff** to handle temporary network issues, and **maintain robust local sample data** as a permanent fallback when remote resources are unavailable.\n\n**Monitor the remote URLs periodically** to detect when they become available again, allowing your application to resume using the remote datasets.",
