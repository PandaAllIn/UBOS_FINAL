  content: 'The 404 errors you''re encountering indicate that the remote JSON files
    cannot be found at the specified GitHub URLs. Here are targeted mitigations for
    this issue:


    ## Verify File Existence and Paths


    **Check that the files actually exist** in the repository at the expected locations.
    Navigate to the ubos-ai/datasets repository on GitHub and confirm that `horizon_sample.json`
    and `erdf_sample.json` are present in the main branch''s root directory. Verify
    the exact file paths match what''s specified in your URLs—even a single character
    difference will cause a 404 error.[2]


    **Ensure case sensitivity is correct.** GitHub Pages and raw content servers are
    case-sensitive, so `Horizon_Sample.json` would not match `horizon_sample.json`.[4]
    Check that your filenames use the exact casing as they appear in the repository.


    ## Confirm Repository Accessibility


    **Verify the repository is public.** If the ubos-ai/datasets repository is private,
    the raw content URLs will return 404 errors. GitHub Pages and raw content hosting
    require public repositories to be accessible.[5] Check the repository settings
    to ensure it''s set to public visibility.


    **Check GitHub''s status page** to rule out any service incidents that might temporarily
    affect raw content delivery.[1]


    ## Address Caching and Deployment Issues


    **Clear your browser cache or test in an incognito window** if you''re verifying
    the URLs directly in a browser, as cached 404 responses can persist.[1][7]


    **Verify the repository has been properly committed and pushed.** Ensure that
    the latest changes containing these JSON files have been committed to the main
    branch and pushed to GitHub. Sometimes the issue stems from uncommitted or unpushed
    changes.[2]


    **Check the repository''s build logs** by navigating to the "Actions" tab in the
    GitHub repository to see if there are any deployment or build issues preventing
    the files from being accessible.[2]


    ## Implement Fallback Strategies


    Since your application is already falling back to samples when remote fetch fails,
    consider **implementing retry logic with exponential backoff** to handle temporary
    network issues, and **maintain robust local sample data** as a permanent fallback
    when remote resources are unavailable.


    **Monitor the remote URLs periodically** to detect when they become available
    again, allowing your application to resume using the remote datasets.'
