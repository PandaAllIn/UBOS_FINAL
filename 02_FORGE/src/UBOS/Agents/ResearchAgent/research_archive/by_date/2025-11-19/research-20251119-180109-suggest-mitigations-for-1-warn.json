    "content": "The warnings you see indicate **404 errors when trying to fetch JSON files from GitHub URLs**, meaning the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` are not found at the specified locations. To mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Paths**  \n   - Double-check that the URLs are correct, including exact file names and case sensitivity, since GitHub URLs are case-sensitive.  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `main` branch under the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository at the specified paths. If the files were moved, renamed, or deleted, update the URLs accordingly[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository `ubos-ai/datasets` is public and the `main` branch is the correct branch serving the files.  \n   - Confirm that GitHub Pages or raw file serving is enabled and properly configured if applicable[3][4].\n\n3. **Repository Permissions and Visibility**  \n   - If the repository or files are private, the fetch will fail with 404 unless proper authentication is used. Make sure the repository is public or that your fetch method supports authentication[3][5].\n\n4. **Fallback Strategy Improvements**  \n   - Since the system falls back to sample data when remote fetch fails, verify that the fallback samples are sufficient for your use case.  \n   - Consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable or dedicated file hosting service if GitHub raw URLs are unreliable for your application.\n\n5. **Cache and Deployment Delays**  \n   - If the files were recently added or updated, allow some time for GitHub to propagate changes. Clear any local or CDN caches that might cause stale 404 errors[4][5].\n\n6. **Alternative Hosting or Versioning**  \n   - If the files are critical and frequently updated, consider versioning them or hosting them on a CDN or cloud storage with guaranteed uptime and stable URLs.\n\n7. **Error Logging and Monitoring**  \n   - Implement logging to capture when fetches fail and alert maintainers to fix missing files promptly.\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is to **ensure the JSON files exist at the specified URLs with correct paths and repository visibility**. If the files are missing, restore or update them. If the URLs are correct but the repository is private, adjust permissions or authentication. Additionally, improve fallback handling and consider alternative hosting for critical resources[1][2][3][4][5].",
