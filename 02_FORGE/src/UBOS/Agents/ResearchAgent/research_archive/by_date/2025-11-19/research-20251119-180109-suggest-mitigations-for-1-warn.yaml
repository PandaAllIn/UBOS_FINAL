  content: "The warnings you see indicate **404 errors when trying to fetch JSON files\
    \ from GitHub URLs**, meaning the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json`\
    \ are not found at the specified locations. To mitigate these errors, consider\
    \ the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Paths**  \n   - Double-check\
    \ that the URLs are correct, including exact file names and case sensitivity,\
    \ since GitHub URLs are case-sensitive.  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `main` branch under the `ubos-ai/datasets`\
    \ repository at the specified paths. If the files were moved, renamed, or deleted,\
    \ update the URLs accordingly[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**\
    \  \n   - Ensure the repository `ubos-ai/datasets` is public and the `main` branch\
    \ is the correct branch serving the files.  \n   - Confirm that GitHub Pages or\
    \ raw file serving is enabled and properly configured if applicable[3][4].\n\n\
    3. **Repository Permissions and Visibility**  \n   - If the repository or files\
    \ are private, the fetch will fail with 404 unless proper authentication is used.\
    \ Make sure the repository is public or that your fetch method supports authentication[3][5].\n\
    \n4. **Fallback Strategy Improvements**  \n   - Since the system falls back to\
    \ sample data when remote fetch fails, verify that the fallback samples are sufficient\
    \ for your use case.  \n   - Consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable\
    \ or dedicated file hosting service if GitHub raw URLs are unreliable for your\
    \ application.\n\n5. **Cache and Deployment Delays**  \n   - If the files were\
    \ recently added or updated, allow some time for GitHub to propagate changes.\
    \ Clear any local or CDN caches that might cause stale 404 errors[4][5].\n\n6.\
    \ **Alternative Hosting or Versioning**  \n   - If the files are critical and\
    \ frequently updated, consider versioning them or hosting them on a CDN or cloud\
    \ storage with guaranteed uptime and stable URLs.\n\n7. **Error Logging and Monitoring**\
    \  \n   - Implement logging to capture when fetches fail and alert maintainers\
    \ to fix missing files promptly.\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is to **ensure\
    \ the JSON files exist at the specified URLs with correct paths and repository\
    \ visibility**. If the files are missing, restore or update them. If the URLs\
    \ are correct but the repository is private, adjust permissions or authentication.\
    \ Additionally, improve fallback handling and consider alternative hosting for\
    \ critical resources[1][2][3][4][5]."
