  content: "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script\
    \ is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`),\
    \ but the server is returning a **404 Not Found** error for both URLs. This means\
    \ the requested files do not exist at the specified locations.\n\nHere are several\
    \ **mitigations and best practices** to address these issues, based on the nature\
    \ of GitHub-hosted content and common causes of 404 errors:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify\
    \ File Existence and Path**\n- **Action:** Manually check if the files exist at\
    \ the URLs:\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n\
    \  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\
    - **How:** Open these URLs in a browser or use `curl`/`wget` to test.\n- **Mitigation:**\
    \ If the files are missing, confirm the correct file names and paths. GitHub is\
    \ **case-sensitive**, so ensure the file names match exactly (e.g., `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ vs `Horizon_Sample.json`).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check Repository Structure and\
    \ Branch**\n- **Action:** Visit the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets\n\
    - **Mitigation:** \n  - Ensure the files are present in the `main` branch (or\
    \ the branch you are targeting).\n  - If the files are in a different branch (e.g.,\
    \ `master`, `dev`), update the URL to reflect the correct branch:\n    ```\n \
    \   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/<branch>/horizon_sample.json\n\
    \    ```\n  - If the files are in a subdirectory, include the full path:\n   \
    \ ```\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/subdir/horizon_sample.json\n\
    \    ```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Handle Missing Files Gracefully**\n- **Action:** Implement\
    \ fallback logic in your code.\n- **Mitigation:** \n  - If the remote fetch fails,\
    \ use local sample data (as you are already doing).\n  - Log a clear warning and\
    \ provide instructions for users to check the file paths or update the repository.\n\
    \  - Example (Python):\n    ```python\n    import requests\n\n    def fetch_json(url,\
    \ fallback_data):\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url)\n  \
    \          response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n \
    \       except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n            if e.response.status_code\
    \ == 404:\n                print(f\"File not found: {url}. Using fallback data.\"\
    )\n                return fallback_data\n            else:\n                raise\
    \ e\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monitor for Repository Changes**\n- **Action:**\
    \ Subscribe to repository updates or use GitHub webhooks.\n- **Mitigation:** \n\
    \  - If the repository is under active development, file names or locations may\
    \ change.\n  - Consider pinning to a specific commit or tag for stability:\n \
    \   ```\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/<commit-hash>/horizon_sample.json\n\
    \    ```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Check for Repository or File Deletion**\n- **Action:**\
    \ Verify that the repository and files have not been deleted or made private.\n\
    - **Mitigation:** \n  - If the repository is private, ensure you have the necessary\
    \ permissions and use authentication (e.g., a personal access token).\n  - If\
    \ files are deleted, contact the repository maintainers or restore from a backup.\n\
    \n---\n\n### 6. **Update Documentation and Configuration**\n- **Action:** Review\
    \ and update any documentation or configuration files that reference these URLs.\n\
    - **Mitigation:** \n  - If the files have moved, update all references to the\
    \ new paths.\n  - Provide clear instructions for users on how to update their\
    \ configurations.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consider Hosting Alternatives**\n- **Action:**\
    \ If the GitHub-hosted files are unreliable, consider hosting the files elsewhere.\n\
    - **Mitigation:** \n  - Use a more stable hosting service (e.g., AWS S3, Google\
    \ Cloud Storage).\n  - Mirror the files in your own repository or a public CDN.\n\
    \n---\n\n### 8. **Automate Health Checks**\n- **Action:** Implement periodic checks\
    \ to verify the availability of remote files.\n- **Mitigation:** \n  - Use a script\
    \ or CI/CD pipeline to test the URLs and alert if they become unavailable.\n \
    \ - Example (bash):\n    ```bash\n    curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\
    \ || echo \"File not found\"\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Immediate:**\
    \ Verify file existence and paths, use fallback data.\n- **Long-term:** Monitor\
    \ for changes, update documentation, consider alternative hosting.\n- **Best Practice:**\
    \ Always handle remote fetch failures gracefully and provide clear error messages.\n\
    \nBy following these mitigations, you can reduce the impact of 404 errors and\
    \ ensure your application remains robust even when remote resources are unavailable."
