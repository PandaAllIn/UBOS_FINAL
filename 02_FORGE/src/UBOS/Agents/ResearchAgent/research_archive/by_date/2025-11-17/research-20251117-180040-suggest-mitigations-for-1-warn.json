    "content": "The warnings indicate that remote fetches for two JSON files from GitHub URLs are failing with 404 errors, meaning the files are not found at the specified URLs. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   - Double-check that the URLs `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json` and `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json` are correct, including case sensitivity and spelling. GitHub URLs are case-sensitive, so any mismatch can cause 404 errors[1][2].  \n   - Confirm that the files actually exist in the `main` branch of the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository. If the files were moved, renamed, or deleted, update the URLs accordingly.\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is public or that your access permissions allow fetching these files if private[2][3].  \n   - Verify that the branch `main` is the correct branch where these files reside. If the files are on a different branch, update the URL to reflect that branch.\n\n3. **GitHub Pages and Deployment Issues**  \n   - If these files are part of a GitHub Pages deployment, confirm that GitHub Pages is enabled and configured correctly in the repository settings[2][3].  \n   - Allow some time for GitHub Pages to build and deploy changes after pushing updates, as delays can cause temporary 404 errors[2].\n\n4. **Fallback and Error Handling**  \n   - Since the system is already falling back to sample data, ensure that fallback mechanisms are robust to handle missing remote files gracefully.  \n   - Consider hosting the files on a more stable or controlled location if GitHub raw URLs are unreliable for your use case.\n\n5. **Alternative Mitigations**  \n   - If the files are permanently unavailable, update your application or dataset references to remove or replace these URLs.  \n   - Use redirects or proxies if you control the domain to point to valid resources[5][7].\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Retry**  \n   - Sometimes browser or CDN caching can cause stale 404 errors. Clear caches or try accessing the URLs from different networks or incognito mode to rule this out[3][4].\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is to **verify the existence and correctness of the files at the specified URLs and ensure repository and branch settings are correct**. If the files are missing, restore or update them. Also, confirm GitHub Pages deployment if relevant and maintain robust fallback handling for missing resources[1][2][3].",
