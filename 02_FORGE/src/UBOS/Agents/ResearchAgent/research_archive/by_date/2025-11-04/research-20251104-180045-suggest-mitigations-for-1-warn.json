    "content": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a 404 error (Not Found). This means the files are either missing, moved, or the repository structure has changed.\n\nHere are several mitigations and best practices to address and prevent such issues:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify the URLs and Repository Structure**\n\n- **Check if the files exist:**  \n  Visit the URLs directly in your browser:\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\n  If these return 404, the files are not present in the repository.\n\n- **Inspect the repository:**  \n  Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets  \n  Look for the files in the `main` branch or check if they exist in a different branch or directory.\n\n- **Check for recent changes:**  \n  Review the repository’s commit history to see if the files were renamed, moved, or deleted.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Update URLs or File Paths**\n\n- If the files have been moved or renamed, update your code to use the correct URLs.\n- If the files are in a different branch (e.g., `master`, `develop`), update the branch name in the URL:\n  ```\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/branch_name/filename.json\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Implement Fallback Logic**\n\n- **Use local samples as fallback:**  \n  Your current approach of falling back to local samples is a good mitigation. Ensure that the fallback data is up-to-date and representative.\n\n- **Graceful degradation:**  \n  Log the warning and continue execution with fallback data, but notify the user or administrator that remote data is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Add Error Handling and Retry Logic**\n\n- **Retry with exponential backoff:**  \n  Sometimes, 404 errors can be temporary (e.g., due to caching or deployment issues). Implement a retry mechanism with increasing delays.\n\n- **Handle different HTTP errors:**  \n  Distinguish between 404 (Not Found), 403 (Forbidden), 500 (Server Error), etc., and respond appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Monitor and Alert**\n\n- **Set up monitoring:**  \n  Use a monitoring tool to periodically check the availability of these URLs and alert you if they become unreachable.\n\n- **Automate checks:**  \n  Write a script to verify the existence of critical files and notify you of changes.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Document and Communicate**\n\n- **Document dependencies:**  \n  Clearly document the external data sources your application relies on, including URLs and expected file formats.\n\n- **Communicate with maintainers:**  \n  If the repository is maintained by a third party, reach out to them to confirm the status of the files and discuss long-term solutions.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consider Alternative Data Sources**\n\n- **Mirror or cache the data:**  \n  If the data is critical and frequently changes, consider mirroring it in your own repository or a more reliable location.\n\n- **Use a data registry or API:**  \n  If available, use a more stable data source or API that provides versioned endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Update Your Codebase**\n\n- **Remove or comment out references to missing files:**  \n  If the files are permanently gone and not needed, remove the code that tries to fetch them.\n\n- **Update documentation and examples:**  \n  Ensure that all documentation reflects the current state of the data sources.\n\n---\n\n### Example Code Snippet (Python)\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef fetch_data(url, fallback_data):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n        if e.response.status_code == 404:\n            print(f\"File not found: {url}. Using fallback data.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"HTTP error: {e}\")\n        return fallback_data\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Request failed: {e}. Using fallback data.\")\n        return fallback_data\n\n# Usage\nhorizon_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\"\nerdf_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\"\n\nhorizon_data = fetch_data(horizon_url, {\"sample\": \"horizon\"})\nerdf_data = fetch_data(erdf_url, {\"sample\": \"erdf\"})\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Verify the existence and location of the files.**\n- **Update URLs or file paths as needed.**\n- **Implement robust error handling and fallback logic.**\n- **Monitor and alert on data source availability.**\n- **Communicate with maintainers and consider alternative sources.**\n\nBy following these steps, you can mitigate the impact of 404 errors and ensure your application remains resilient to changes in external data sources.",
