  content: "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON datasets from\
    \ GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing fallback to local samples.\
    \ This means the files at these URLs do not exist or are inaccessible:\n\n- Horizon\
    \ Europe: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\
    \  \n- European Regional Development Fund: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\
    \nTo mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs\
    \ and File Existence**  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and\
    \ `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `main` branch of the `ubos-ai/datasets`\
    \ GitHub repository.  \n   - Check for typos, case sensitivity, or changes in\
    \ file paths or names, as GitHub URLs are case-sensitive and exact[2][3].\n\n\
    2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is public\
    \ if you are fetching files without authentication, as private repos require credentials\
    \ and may cause 404 errors[5][7].  \n   - Confirm the branch name is correct (`main`\
    \ in this case) and that the files are present there.\n\n3. **Update or Restore\
    \ Missing Files**  \n   - If the files were deleted or moved, restore them or\
    \ update your fetch URLs to point to the correct location.  \n   - If you control\
    \ the repository, commit and push the missing files to the expected paths.\n\n\
    4. **Use Alternative Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   - If the remote files are\
    \ unreliable or frequently missing, consider hosting them on a stable platform\
    \ or bundling them with your application to avoid remote fetch failures.  \n \
    \  - Continue using fallback samples as a temporary measure but aim to resolve\
    \ the root cause.\n\n5. **Check GitHub Status and Cache**  \n   - Verify GitHub’s\
    \ status page for any ongoing incidents that might affect raw content delivery[1].\
    \  \n   - Clear local caches or try fetching the URLs in a private/incognito browser\
    \ window to rule out caching issues[1][7].\n\n6. **Logging and Alerts**  \n  \
    \ - Implement logging to capture these warnings and alert maintainers promptly\
    \ so missing files can be addressed quickly.\n\nIn summary, the core mitigation\
    \ is to ensure the referenced JSON files exist at the specified URLs in the GitHub\
    \ repository, with correct paths and repository visibility. If you do not control\
    \ the repository, contact its maintainers to report the missing files or update\
    \ your system to handle such remote fetch failures gracefully[1][2][3][5]."
