  content: "The warnings indicate **404 Client Error: Not Found** when trying to fetch\
    \ JSON files from GitHub raw URLs, causing fallback to local samples. This means\
    \ the files at these URLs do not exist or are inaccessible.\n\nTo mitigate these\
    \ errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and file existence**\
    \  \n   - Double-check that the URLs are correct, including exact file names,\
    \ paths, and case sensitivity (GitHub URLs are case-sensitive)[1][3][7].  \n \
    \  - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually\
    \ exist in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository under the `main` branch at the specified\
    \ path. If the files were moved, renamed, or deleted, update the URLs accordingly.\n\
    \n2. **Check repository and branch settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is\
    \ public if you want public access to the files[1][7].  \n   - Confirm the branch\
    \ name is correct (`main` or default branch) and the files are committed there[1][7].\n\
    \n3. **Handle missing files gracefully**  \n   - Since the system already falls\
    \ back to local samples, ensure these local samples are up-to-date and sufficient\
    \ for your use case.  \n   - Consider adding error handling or logging to alert\
    \ when remote fetch fails, so you can investigate promptly.\n\n4. **If URLs are\
    \ correct but still 404**  \n   - Check if GitHub raw URLs have changed or if\
    \ there are temporary GitHub outages by consulting GitHub Status[1][7].  \n  \
    \ - Sometimes, GitHub raw URLs require specific formatting, e.g., using `refs/heads/main`\
    \ or `refs/tags/<tag>` in the URL path. Verify the correct raw URL format[2].\n\
    \n5. **Alternative hosting or caching**  \n   - If the files are critical and\
    \ frequently accessed, consider hosting them on a more stable or dedicated CDN\
    \ or storage service to avoid GitHub raw URL limitations.  \n   - Alternatively,\
    \ cache the files locally or in your infrastructure to reduce dependency on remote\
    \ fetch.\n\n6. **Update your fetching mechanism**  \n   - Implement retries with\
    \ exponential backoff in case of transient errors.  \n   - Validate the response\
    \ status before processing the data.\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is\
    \ to **confirm the existence and correctness of the remote files and URLs** and\
    \ ensure repository visibility and branch correctness. If the files are missing\
    \ or moved, update the URLs or restore the files. Meanwhile, maintain robust fallback\
    \ and error handling for uninterrupted operation[1][2][3][7]."
