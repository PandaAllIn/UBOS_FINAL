  content: 'The capital of Romania is **Bucharest**. It is the largest city in the
    country and serves as its cultural, industrial, financial, and political center[1][2][3].


    Bucharest is located in the southeast of Romania, on the banks of the Dâmbovița
    River, near the Danube and the Bulgarian border[1][3]. It became the capital in
    1862 and has a rich history, with its first mention dating back to 1459[1][4].
    The city is known for its diverse architecture, ranging from historical styles
    like neo-classical and Art Nouveau to communist-era and modern buildings[1].


    With a population of about 1.7 million within the city limits and over 2 million
    in the metropolitan area, Bucharest is one of the largest urban centers in the
    European Union[1][3][6]. It is often nicknamed "Little Paris" due to its elegant
    architecture and cultural sophistication, especially in the early 20th century[1][5].


    In summary, Bucharest is the political and cultural heart of Romania and has been
    its capital for over 160 years[1][2][3][7].'
