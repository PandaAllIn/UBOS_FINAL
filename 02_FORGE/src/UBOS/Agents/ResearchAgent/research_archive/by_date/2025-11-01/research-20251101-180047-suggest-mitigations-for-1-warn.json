GitHub URLs are case-sensitive, so even capitalization differences can cause 404 errors[3][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is public or that your access permissions allow fetching raw files. Private repos require authentication to access raw content.  \n   - Verify that the branch name is correct (`main` in this case) and that the files are present in that branch[2][7].\n\n3. **Confirm GitHub Pages or Raw Content Availability**  \n   - If these files are served via GitHub Pages or raw content URLs, confirm that GitHub Pages is properly configured and the files are published.  \n   - If using GitHub Pages, ensure the publishing source is set correctly and that an `index.html` or equivalent landing page exists to avoid 404 errors[2][4].\n\n4. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   - If the files were deleted or moved, restore them or update the URLs to point to the correct location.  \n   - If the files never existed, add them to the repository or adjust your application to not rely on these remote files.\n\n5. **Implement Fallback Handling**  \n   - Since the system already falls back to local samples, ensure these fallback samples are up-to-date and sufficient for operation when remote fetch fails.\n\n6. **Cache and CDN Considerations**  \n   - Clear any caches that might be serving outdated 404 responses.  \n   - If using a CDN or proxy, verify it is not blocking or caching missing content incorrectly[5].\n\n7. **Monitor GitHub Status and Logs**  \n   - Check GitHub’s status page for any ongoing incidents affecting raw content delivery[2].  \n   - Review build or fetch logs for additional clues.\n\n8. **Testing and Debugging Steps**  \n   - Try accessing the URLs directly in a browser or via `curl` to confirm the 404 error.  \n   - Clone the repository locally and verify the files’ presence and paths.  \n   - If you have control over the repository, try pushing a simple test file and fetching it to confirm the fetch mechanism works.\n\nBy systematically verifying file existence, URL correctness, repository settings, and fallback mechanisms, you can resolve or mitigate these 404 fetch warnings effectively.",
