  content: "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from\
    \ GitHub URLs failed with a 404 error, meaning the files are not found at the\
    \ specified URLs. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n\
    1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository under\
    \ the `main` branch at the specified path. A 404 error usually means the files\
    \ are missing, renamed, or moved. Check the repository directly on GitHub to ensure\
    \ the files are present and accessible[1][2].\n\n2. **Check for Typos and Case\
    \ Sensitivity**  \n   GitHub URLs and file paths are case-sensitive. Ensure the\
    \ filenames and paths in your fetch requests exactly match the case and spelling\
    \ of the files in the repository. For example, `Horizon_sample.json` is different\
    \ from `horizon_sample.json`[2][4].\n\n3. **Confirm Repository and Branch Settings**\
    \  \n   Make sure the repository is public and the branch (`main`) is correct.\
    \ If the repository is private or the branch name is different, fetching raw files\
    \ via the URL will fail with 404[6][8].\n\n4. **Update or Restore Missing Files**\
    \  \n   If the files were deleted or moved, restore them or update your fetch\
    \ URLs to point to the correct location. If you do not control the repository,\
    \ contact the maintainers to confirm the availability of these files.\n\n5. **Use\
    \ Fallbacks or Local Copies**  \n   Since your system already falls back to sample\
    \ data when remote fetch fails, ensure that fallback samples are up-to-date and\
    \ sufficient for your use case. Consider bundling essential sample files locally\
    \ to avoid dependency on remote fetches.\n\n6. **Check GitHub Status and Cache**\
    \  \n   Occasionally, GitHub may have outages or caching issues causing temporary\
    \ 404 errors. Check GitHub’s status page and clear your local cache or try fetching\
    \ from a different network or incognito browser session[1][8].\n\n7. **If Using\
    \ GitHub Pages for Hosting**  \n   If these files are served via GitHub Pages,\
    \ ensure the Pages site is correctly configured, the branch is published, and\
    \ the files are in the published directory. GitHub Pages is case-sensitive and\
    \ requires a valid index file for the site to serve content properly[1][4].\n\n\
    By systematically verifying file presence, URL correctness, repository visibility,\
    \ and fallback strategies, you can mitigate these 404 fetch failures effectively.\
    \ If the problem persists after these checks, consider opening an issue with the\
    \ repository maintainers or your development team for further investigation[2][5]."
