    "content": "The capital of Romania is **Bucharest**. It is the largest city in the country and serves as its cultural, industrial, financial, and political center[1][2][3].\n\nBucharest is located in the southeast of Romania, on the banks of the Dâmbovița River, near the Danube and the Bulgarian border[1][3]. It became the capital in 1862 and has a rich history, with its first mention dating back to 1459[1][4]. The city is known for its diverse architecture, ranging from historical styles like neo-classical and Art Nouveau to communist-era and modern buildings[1].\n\nWith a population of about 1.7 million within the city limits and over 2 million in the metropolitan area, Bucharest is one of the largest urban centers in the European Union[1][3][6]. It is often nicknamed \"Little Paris\" due to its elegant architecture and cultural sophistication, especially in the early 20th century[1][5].\n\nIn summary, Bucharest is the political and cultural heart of Romania and has been its capital for over 160 years[1][2][3][7].",
