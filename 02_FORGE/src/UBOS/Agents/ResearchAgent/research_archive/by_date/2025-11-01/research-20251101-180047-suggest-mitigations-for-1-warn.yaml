  content: "The warnings indicate that the system is trying to fetch JSON files from\
    \ URLs on GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\
    \ and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json)\
    \ but receives a 404 Not Found error, meaning the files are missing or the URLs\
    \ are incorrect.\n\n**Mitigations for these 404 Remote Fetch Failures:**\n\n1.\
    \ **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `main` branch of the `ubos-ai/datasets`\
    \ GitHub repository.  \n   - Check for typos, case sensitivity, or incorrect file\
    \ paths in the URLs. GitHub URLs are case-sensitive, so even capitalization differences\
    \ can cause 404 errors[3][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings** \
    \ \n   - Ensure the repository is public or that your access permissions allow\
    \ fetching raw files. Private repos require authentication to access raw content.\
    \  \n   - Verify that the branch name is correct (`main` in this case) and that\
    \ the files are present in that branch[2][7].\n\n3. **Confirm GitHub Pages or\
    \ Raw Content Availability**  \n   - If these files are served via GitHub Pages\
    \ or raw content URLs, confirm that GitHub Pages is properly configured and the\
    \ files are published.  \n   - If using GitHub Pages, ensure the publishing source\
    \ is set correctly and that an `index.html` or equivalent landing page exists\
    \ to avoid 404 errors[2][4].\n\n4. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   -\
    \ If the files were deleted or moved, restore them or update the URLs to point\
    \ to the correct location.  \n   - If the files never existed, add them to the\
    \ repository or adjust your application to not rely on these remote files.\n\n\
    5. **Implement Fallback Handling**  \n   - Since the system already falls back\
    \ to local samples, ensure these fallback samples are up-to-date and sufficient\
    \ for operation when remote fetch fails.\n\n6. **Cache and CDN Considerations**\
    \  \n   - Clear any caches that might be serving outdated 404 responses.  \n \
    \  - If using a CDN or proxy, verify it is not blocking or caching missing content\
    \ incorrectly[5].\n\n7. **Monitor GitHub Status and Logs**  \n   - Check GitHub’s\
    \ status page for any ongoing incidents affecting raw content delivery[2].  \n\
    \   - Review build or fetch logs for additional clues.\n\n8. **Testing and Debugging\
    \ Steps**  \n   - Try accessing the URLs directly in a browser or via `curl` to\
    \ confirm the 404 error.  \n   - Clone the repository locally and verify the files’\
    \ presence and paths.  \n   - If you have control over the repository, try pushing\
    \ a simple test file and fetching it to confirm the fetch mechanism works.\n\n\
    By systematically verifying file existence, URL correctness, repository settings,\
    \ and fallback mechanisms, you can resolve or mitigate these 404 fetch warnings\
    \ effectively."
