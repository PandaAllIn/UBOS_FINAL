    "content": "The warnings indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing fallback to sample data. To mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Ensure that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the GitHub repository at the specified paths (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/`). A 404 error means the files are missing or the URL is incorrect. Check for typos, case sensitivity, or if the files were moved or deleted[3][5].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   Confirm that the repository is public and the branch (`main`) is correct. If the repository or branch is private or renamed, the raw URLs will return 404 errors[8][9].\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   If the files were accidentally deleted or moved, restore them or update the URLs in your code to point to the correct location. If the files never existed, add the required JSON files to the repository.\n\n4. **Use a Reliable Hosting or Backup**  \n   If GitHub raw URLs are unreliable or files are frequently missing, consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable platform or maintain a local copy to avoid fallback to samples.\n\n5. **Implement Error Handling and Logging**  \n   Since your system already falls back to sample data on fetch failure, enhance logging to alert maintainers when remote fetches fail, so issues can be addressed promptly.\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Confirm Deployment**  \n   Sometimes stale cache or deployment delays cause 404 errors. Clear browser or server caches and verify that the latest repository changes are pushed and deployed correctly[2][4].\n\n7. **Check GitHub Pages or Raw Content Access Issues**  \n   If these files are served via GitHub Pages or raw content URLs, ensure GitHub Pages is configured correctly and the files are accessible publicly. Misconfiguration can cause 404 errors[1][2].\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is to **ensure the JSON files exist at the specified URLs and are publicly accessible**. Then verify repository settings and deployment status. Implement monitoring to detect and respond to such fetch failures quickly. If necessary, maintain local copies or alternative hosting to guarantee availability.",
