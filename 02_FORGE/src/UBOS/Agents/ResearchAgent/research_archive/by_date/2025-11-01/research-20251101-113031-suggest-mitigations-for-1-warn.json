    "content": "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 error, meaning the files are not found at the specified URLs. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository under the `main` branch at the specified path. A 404 error usually means the files are missing, renamed, or moved. Check the repository directly on GitHub to ensure the files are present and accessible[1][2].\n\n2. **Check for Typos and Case Sensitivity**  \n   GitHub URLs and file paths are case-sensitive. Ensure the filenames and paths in your fetch requests exactly match the case and spelling of the files in the repository. For example, `Horizon_sample.json` is different from `horizon_sample.json`[2][4].\n\n3. **Confirm Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   Make sure the repository is public and the branch (`main`) is correct. If the repository is private or the branch name is different, fetching raw files via the URL will fail with 404[6][8].\n\n4. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   If the files were deleted or moved, restore them or update your fetch URLs to point to the correct location. If you do not control the repository, contact the maintainers to confirm the availability of these files.\n\n5. **Use Fallbacks or Local Copies**  \n   Since your system already falls back to sample data when remote fetch fails, ensure that fallback samples are up-to-date and sufficient for your use case. Consider bundling essential sample files locally to avoid dependency on remote fetches.\n\n6. **Check GitHub Status and Cache**  \n   Occasionally, GitHub may have outages or caching issues causing temporary 404 errors. Check GitHub’s status page and clear your local cache or try fetching from a different network or incognito browser session[1][8].\n\n7. **If Using GitHub Pages for Hosting**  \n   If these files are served via GitHub Pages, ensure the Pages site is correctly configured, the branch is published, and the files are in the published directory. GitHub Pages is case-sensitive and requires a valid index file for the site to serve content properly[1][4].\n\nBy systematically verifying file presence, URL correctness, repository visibility, and fallback strategies, you can mitigate these 404 fetch failures effectively. If the problem persists after these checks, consider opening an issue with the repository maintainers or your development team for further investigation[2][5].",
