    "summary": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a public GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error.",
    "content": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a public GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error. This means the files do not exist at the specified locations.\n\nHere are several **mitigations and best practices** to address this issue:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify the URLs and File Paths**\n- Double-check the URLs for typos or incorrect paths.\n- Ensure the file names (`horizon_sample.json`, `erdf_sample.json`) and the branch (`main`) are correct.\n- Visit the URLs directly in your browser to confirm if the files exist:\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\nIf the files do not exist, you will need to either:\n- **Contact the repository owner** to confirm the correct file names or locations.\n- **Look for alternative files** or updated paths in the repository.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check the Repository Structure**\n- Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets\n- Browse the `main` branch and search for the files (`horizon_sample.json`, `erdf_sample.json`).\n- If the files are in a different directory or have different names, update your URLs accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Use Fallbacks or Default Samples**\n- Since your system is already falling back to samples, ensure that the fallback mechanism is robust and provides meaningful data.\n- Consider adding a **warning message** or **logging** to notify users or developers when remote fetch fails.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Implement Retry Logic**\n- Add retry logic with exponential backoff in case the failure is temporary (e.g., network issues).\n- Example (Python):\n  ```python\n  import requests\n  from time import sleep\n\n  def fetch_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):\n      for i in range(max_retries):\n          try:\n              response = requests.get(url)\n              response.raise_for_status()\n              return response.json()\n          except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n              if i < max_retries - 1:\n                  sleep(2 ** i)  # Exponential backoff\n              else:\n                  print(f\"Failed to fetch {url} after {max_retries} retries: {e}\")\n                  return None\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Cache Remote Data Locally**\n- Cache the fetched data locally (e.g., in a file or database) so that subsequent requests do not need to fetch from the remote server.\n- This reduces the impact of temporary 404 errors and improves performance.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Monitor and Alert**\n- Set up monitoring to alert you when remote fetches fail.\n- This helps you quickly identify and resolve issues with external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Document and Communicate**\n- Document the expected file locations and fallback behavior in your project’s README or documentation.\n- Communicate with stakeholders or users about potential data source issues and fallback strategies.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Consider Alternative Data Sources**\n- If the files are consistently missing, consider finding alternative data sources or creating your own sample files.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Check for Repository or Branch Changes**\n- Sometimes, repositories are renamed, branches are changed, or files are moved. Check the repository’s recent activity or releases for any changes.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Open an Issue or Pull Request**\n- If you believe the files should exist but are missing, open an issue on the repository’s GitHub page to notify the maintainers.\n- If you have the correct files, consider submitting a pull request to add them.\n\n---\n\nBy implementing these mitigations, you can improve the reliability and resilience of your application when dealing with remote data sources.",
