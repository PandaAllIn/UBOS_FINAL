    "content": "# Mitigations for Remote Fetch 404 Errors\n\nThe 404 errors you're encountering indicate that the JSON files at the specified URLs in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository are not being found. Here are the recommended mitigations:\n\n## Verify File Existence and Paths\n\n**Check that the files actually exist** in the repository at the expected locations. The files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` must be present in the root directory of the `main` branch. File paths are case-sensitive on GitHub, so ensure the filenames match exactly—`horizon_sample.json` and `Horizon_sample.json` are treated as different files[1].\n\nNavigate to the repository directly and confirm both files are committed and pushed to the `main` branch. If the files don't exist, they need to be created and committed first.\n\n## Verify Repository Accessibility\n\n**Ensure the repository is public** if you need to access these files remotely. Private repositories won't be accessible via raw GitHub URLs, which will result in 404 errors[1]. Check the repository settings and confirm it's set to public visibility.\n\n## Check GitHub Pages Deployment Status\n\n**Allow time for GitHub Pages to rebuild** after any recent changes. It can take up to 10 minutes for GitHub Pages to build and publish your site after pushing updates[3]. If you've recently modified the repository, wait a few minutes before retrying the fetch.\n\n## Clear Browser Cache and Retry\n\n**Clear your browser cache** or try accessing the URL in an incognito/private browsing window[5]. Sometimes cached 404 responses can persist even after files are added.\n\n## Verify the Raw GitHub URL Format\n\n**Confirm the URL format is correct** for accessing raw file content. The correct format should be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[owner]/[repository]/[branch]/[file-path]`. Double-check that the owner name (`ubos-ai`), repository name (`datasets`), branch name (`main`), and file paths are all accurate[1].\n\n## Check for Special Characters or Hidden Files\n\n**If the files contain underscores or start with special characters**, ensure they're not being filtered by Jekyll processing. GitHub Pages can skip files and directories starting with underscores. If this is an issue, create a `.nojekyll` file in the repository root to bypass Jekyll processing[1].\n\n## Verify Repository Permissions\n\n**Ensure the account accessing the repository has appropriate permissions**. If the repository visibility was recently changed from public to private or vice versa, the URLs may have changed, resulting in broken links until the site is rebuilt[4].",
