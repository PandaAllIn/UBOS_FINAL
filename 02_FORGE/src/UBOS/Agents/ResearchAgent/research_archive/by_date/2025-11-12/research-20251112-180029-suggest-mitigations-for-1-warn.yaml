  content: '# Mitigations for Remote Fetch 404 Errors


    The 404 errors you''re encountering indicate that the JSON files at the specified
    URLs in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository are not being found. Here are the recommended
    mitigations:


    ## Verify File Existence and Paths


    **Check that the files actually exist** in the repository at the expected locations.
    The files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` must be present in the
    root directory of the `main` branch. File paths are case-sensitive on GitHub,
    so ensure the filenames match exactly—`horizon_sample.json` and `Horizon_sample.json`
    are treated as different files[1].


    Navigate to the repository directly and confirm both files are committed and pushed
    to the `main` branch. If the files don''t exist, they need to be created and committed
    first.


    ## Verify Repository Accessibility


    **Ensure the repository is public** if you need to access these files remotely.
    Private repositories won''t be accessible via raw GitHub URLs, which will result
    in 404 errors[1]. Check the repository settings and confirm it''s set to public
    visibility.


    ## Check GitHub Pages Deployment Status


    **Allow time for GitHub Pages to rebuild** after any recent changes. It can take
    up to 10 minutes for GitHub Pages to build and publish your site after pushing
    updates[3]. If you''ve recently modified the repository, wait a few minutes before
    retrying the fetch.


    ## Clear Browser Cache and Retry


    **Clear your browser cache** or try accessing the URL in an incognito/private
    browsing window[5]. Sometimes cached 404 responses can persist even after files
    are added.


    ## Verify the Raw GitHub URL Format


    **Confirm the URL format is correct** for accessing raw file content. The correct
    format should be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[owner]/[repository]/[branch]/[file-path]`.
    Double-check that the owner name (`ubos-ai`), repository name (`datasets`), branch
    name (`main`), and file paths are all accurate[1].


    ## Check for Special Characters or Hidden Files


    **If the files contain underscores or start with special characters**, ensure
    they''re not being filtered by Jekyll processing. GitHub Pages can skip files
    and directories starting with underscores. If this is an issue, create a `.nojekyll`
    file in the repository root to bypass Jekyll processing[1].


    ## Verify Repository Permissions


    **Ensure the account accessing the repository has appropriate permissions**. If
    the repository visibility was recently changed from public to private or vice
    versa, the URLs may have changed, resulting in broken links until the site is
    rebuilt[4].'
