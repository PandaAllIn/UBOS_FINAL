    "content": "The warnings you see indicate that fetching JSON datasets from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing fallback to sample data. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and Repository Content**  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository under the `main` branch at the specified paths. A 404 error means the files are missing or the path is incorrect.  \n   - Check for typos or case sensitivity issues in the filenames and URLs, as GitHub is case-sensitive[2][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository Visibility and Access**  \n   - Ensure the repository and files are public if your fetch is unauthenticated, as private repos may cause 404 errors for anonymous requests[6][7].  \n   - If authentication is required, verify that your fetch mechanism includes proper credentials or tokens.\n\n3. **Confirm GitHub Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Verify that the repository is not archived or deleted and that the branch (`main`) is the correct one hosting the files.  \n   - If the repository was recently changed (e.g., branch renamed or files moved), update the URLs accordingly[1][4].\n\n4. **Use Reliable Hosting or Mirror the Files**  \n   - If the GitHub repository is unstable or files are frequently moved/deleted, consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable platform or your own server.  \n   - Alternatively, maintain a local or internal copy of these datasets to avoid remote fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement Robust Fallback and Monitoring**  \n   - Continue to use fallback samples as a backup but add monitoring or alerts to detect when remote fetches fail, so you can address missing files promptly.  \n   - Automate periodic checks of the URLs to catch 404 errors early[3].\n\n6. **If Using GitHub Pages or Similar Hosting**  \n   - If these files are served via GitHub Pages, ensure the site is correctly built and published, with a valid `index.html` or equivalent landing page, and that GitHub Pages is enabled and configured properly[1][4].  \n   - Clear browser or server caches if stale redirects or cached 404s might be causing issues[1][7].\n\n7. **Contact Repository Maintainers or GitHub Support**  \n   - If you do not control the repository, reach out to the maintainers to confirm file availability or report missing resources.  \n   - For persistent or unclear issues, GitHub support or community forums may provide additional help[2][5].\n\nBy systematically verifying file existence, repository settings, and access permissions, and by implementing fallback strategies and monitoring, you can mitigate these 404 fetch failures effectively.",
