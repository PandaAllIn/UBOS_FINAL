    "content": "The warnings indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing fallback to local samples. To mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the specified GitHub repository path (`ubos-ai/datasets/main/`). A 404 error usually means the files are missing, renamed, or moved. Check the repository directly on GitHub to ensure the files are present and the URLs are correct, including case sensitivity and exact file names[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   Ensure the repository is public or that your access permissions allow fetching files if it is private. Also, verify that the branch (`main`) is correct and that GitHub Pages or raw file serving is enabled properly if applicable[2][3][8].\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   If the files were accidentally deleted or moved, restore them or update the URLs in your code to point to the correct location. If you control the repository, push the missing files to the correct path.\n\n4. **Use Alternative Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   If the remote files are unreliable or frequently missing, consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable platform or bundling them locally with your application to avoid remote fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks**  \n   Since your system already falls back to samples, ensure this fallback is robust and clearly logged. You might also implement retries or alerts to notify maintainers when remote fetch fails.\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Allow Time for Updates**  \n   Sometimes GitHub Pages or raw file URLs take time to update after changes. Clear caches and wait a few minutes after pushing changes to ensure the files are accessible[2][3].\n\n7. **Check for Repository Visibility or Deployment Issues**  \n   If the repository visibility changed recently (e.g., from public to private), this can cause 404 errors. Revert visibility or adjust access accordingly. Also, verify deployment logs if using automated deployment tools[4][6].\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation is to **ensure the JSON files exist at the specified URLs and that the URLs are correct and accessible**. Secondary mitigations include improving error handling, considering alternative hosting, and verifying repository and deployment settings to prevent 404 errors on remote fetches[1][2][3][4].",
