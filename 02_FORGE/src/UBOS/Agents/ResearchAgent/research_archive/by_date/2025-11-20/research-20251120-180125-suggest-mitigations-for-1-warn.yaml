  content: "The warnings indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub\
    \ URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing fallback to local samples. To\
    \ mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs\
    \ and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and\
    \ `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the specified GitHub repository path (`ubos-ai/datasets/main/`).\
    \ A 404 error usually means the files are missing, renamed, or moved. Check the\
    \ repository directly on GitHub to ensure the files are present and the URLs are\
    \ correct, including case sensitivity and exact file names[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Check\
    \ Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   Ensure the repository is public or that\
    \ your access permissions allow fetching files if it is private. Also, verify\
    \ that the branch (`main`) is correct and that GitHub Pages or raw file serving\
    \ is enabled properly if applicable[2][3][8].\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing\
    \ Files**  \n   If the files were accidentally deleted or moved, restore them\
    \ or update the URLs in your code to point to the correct location. If you control\
    \ the repository, push the missing files to the correct path.\n\n4. **Use Alternative\
    \ Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   If the remote files are unreliable or frequently\
    \ missing, consider hosting the JSON files on a more stable platform or bundling\
    \ them locally with your application to avoid remote fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement\
    \ Error Handling and Fallbacks**  \n   Since your system already falls back to\
    \ samples, ensure this fallback is robust and clearly logged. You might also implement\
    \ retries or alerts to notify maintainers when remote fetch fails.\n\n6. **Clear\
    \ Cache and Allow Time for Updates**  \n   Sometimes GitHub Pages or raw file\
    \ URLs take time to update after changes. Clear caches and wait a few minutes\
    \ after pushing changes to ensure the files are accessible[2][3].\n\n7. **Check\
    \ for Repository Visibility or Deployment Issues**  \n   If the repository visibility\
    \ changed recently (e.g., from public to private), this can cause 404 errors.\
    \ Revert visibility or adjust access accordingly. Also, verify deployment logs\
    \ if using automated deployment tools[4][6].\n\nIn summary, the primary mitigation\
    \ is to **ensure the JSON files exist at the specified URLs and that the URLs\
    \ are correct and accessible**. Secondary mitigations include improving error\
    \ handling, considering alternative hosting, and verifying repository and deployment\
    \ settings to prevent 404 errors on remote fetches[1][2][3][4]."
