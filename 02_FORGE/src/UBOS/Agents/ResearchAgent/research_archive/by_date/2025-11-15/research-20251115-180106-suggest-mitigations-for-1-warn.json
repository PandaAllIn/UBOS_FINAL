    "content": "# Mitigations for Remote Fetch 404 Errors\n\nThe 404 errors you're encountering indicate that the application cannot locate the JSON files at the specified GitHub URLs. Here are the key mitigations to resolve this issue:\n\n## Verify File Existence and Paths\n\n**Check that the files actually exist** in the repository at the expected locations. The files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` must be present in the root of the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository on the `main` branch. Verify the exact file names and paths match what's specified in your URLs, as GitHub is case-sensitive[1]. A file named `Horizon_sample.json` would be different from `horizon_sample.json`.\n\n## Confirm Repository Accessibility\n\n**Ensure the repository is public** if your application needs to access these files remotely[1]. If the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository is private, the remote fetch will fail with a 404 error. Check the repository settings to confirm it's publicly accessible.\n\n## Validate the Raw Content URL Format\n\n**Verify the raw content URL is correctly formatted**. The URL structure should be:\n```\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[owner]/[repository]/[branch]/[file-path]\n```\n\nIn your case, confirm that:\n- Owner: `ubos-ai`\n- Repository: `datasets`\n- Branch: `main` (not `master` or another branch)\n- File paths: `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json`\n\nIf the files are in a subdirectory, the path must include that directory structure.\n\n## Check Branch Configuration\n\n**Verify the files are committed to the `main` branch**[1]. If the files exist but are on a different branch (such as `develop` or `gh-pages`), update your URLs to reference the correct branch, or ensure the files are pushed to the `main` branch.\n\n## Allow Time for Propagation\n\n**Wait a few minutes after pushing changes** to the repository. GitHub may take up to 10 minutes to make newly pushed content available through the raw content URL[3].\n\n## Implement Fallback Handling\n\nYour application already has a fallback mechanism (\"Falling back to samples\"), which is good practice. Ensure this fallback provides acceptable default data while you resolve the remote fetch issue. Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network issues.\n\n## Monitor GitHub Status\n\n**Check GitHub's Status page** for any active incidents that might affect raw content delivery[4]. Temporary service disruptions could cause these failures.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\nIf the remote files are frequently unavailable or unreliable, consider:\n- **Bundling sample data** directly with your application instead of fetching remotely\n- **Using a more reliable CDN** or hosting the files on a dedicated server\n- **Implementing caching** to reduce dependency on remote fetches",
