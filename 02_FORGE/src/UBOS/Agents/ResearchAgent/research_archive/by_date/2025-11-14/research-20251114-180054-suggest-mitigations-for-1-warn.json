    "content": "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing your system to fall back to local sample data. This means the files at these URLs do not exist or are inaccessible:\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json  \n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\nTo mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   - Double-check that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository under the `main` branch.  \n   - Confirm the file names are spelled correctly and match case sensitivity exactly, as GitHub URLs are case-sensitive[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is public or that your system has proper access permissions if it is private.  \n   - Confirm the branch name is correct (`main` in this case) and that the files are present in that branch[2][3].\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   - If the files were deleted or moved, restore them to the expected path or update your fetch URLs to point to the correct location.  \n   - If you control the repository, push the missing files to the correct path.\n\n4. **Use Alternative Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   - If the remote files are unreliable or frequently missing, consider hosting the JSON files in a more stable location or bundling them locally with your application to avoid runtime fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks**  \n   - Since your system already falls back to sample data, ensure this fallback is robust and clearly logged so you can monitor how often remote fetches fail.\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Allow Time for Updates**  \n   - If you recently added or updated files, allow some time for GitHub to propagate changes and clear any local or CDN caches that might cause stale 404 errors[2][3].\n\n7. **Check GitHub Status and Permissions**  \n   - Verify GitHub’s status page for any ongoing incidents that might affect raw file access.  \n   - Confirm your authentication tokens or access rights if the repository is private or requires authorization[3][5].\n\nIf after these steps the files remain inaccessible, you may want to:\n\n- Contact the repository maintainers to confirm the files’ availability.  \n- Open an issue in the repository or GitHub community forums for further assistance.\n\nThese mitigations address common causes of 404 errors when fetching files from GitHub raw URLs and help ensure your application can reliably access required data or handle failures gracefully[1][2][3][4][5].",
