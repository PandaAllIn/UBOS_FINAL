    "content": "The 404 errors you're encountering indicate that the remote JSON files are not accessible at the specified URLs in the GitHub repository. Here are the mitigations you should implement:\n\n## Verify File Existence and Paths\n\nFirst, confirm that the files actually exist in the repository at the expected locations. Check the GitHub repository directly to ensure:\n\n- The files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` exist in the `main` branch\n- The files are in the root directory of the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository\n- The file names match exactly (case-sensitive) with what's specified in your URLs\n\n## Check Repository Visibility and Permissions\n\nEnsure the `ubos-ai/datasets` repository is **public**. If the repository is private, you won't be able to fetch raw files via the public GitHub raw content URL without proper authentication. If it's currently private, either make it public or implement authentication in your fetch requests.\n\n## Verify Raw Content URL Format\n\nThe URL format for accessing raw GitHub files should be:\n```\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{file-path}\n```\n\nDouble-check that your URLs follow this exact pattern and that the branch name is correct (typically `main` or `master`).\n\n## Allow Time for GitHub Updates\n\nIf the files were recently added or moved, GitHub may need time to propagate the changes. Wait a few minutes and retry the fetch operation, as it can take up to 10 minutes for GitHub to fully update and serve new content.\n\n## Implement Fallback Mechanisms\n\nSince your application already has a fallback to samples when remote fetch fails, ensure that:\n\n- Your local sample data is complete and accurate\n- The fallback behavior is intentional and acceptable for your use case\n- Users are aware when they're using local samples instead of remote data\n\n## Add Error Handling and Logging\n\nImplement more detailed logging to capture:\n\n- The exact timestamp of the fetch attempt\n- The HTTP response headers\n- Whether the repository exists and is accessible\n- The current branch being targeted\n\nThis will help you diagnose whether the issue is temporary or persistent.\n\n## Test Direct Access\n\nTry accessing the URLs directly in your browser or using a tool like `curl` to verify they're accessible:\n\n```bash\ncurl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\ncurl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n```\n\nIf these return 404 responses, the files don't exist at those locations.\n\n## Consider Alternative Data Sources\n\nIf the remote files are consistently unavailable, consider:\n\n- Hosting the JSON files on a more reliable CDN\n- Bundling the sample data directly with your application\n- Using an alternative data repository or API endpoint",
