    "summary": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two JSON files from a public GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error.",
    "content": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two JSON files from a public GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error. This means the files do not exist at the specified locations, or the repository structure has changed.\n\nHere are several **mitigations and best practices** to address and prevent such issues:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify the URLs and Repository Structure**\n- Double-check the URLs:\n  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json`\n  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json`\n- Visit the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets\n- Confirm if the files exist in the `main` branch and if the file names are correct (case-sensitive).\n- If the files have been moved, renamed, or deleted, update your code to use the correct paths.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Use Fallbacks and Graceful Degradation**\n- Your current approach of falling back to local samples is good. Ensure that:\n  - The fallback data is up-to-date and representative.\n  - The fallback logic is robust and logs when remote fetch fails.\n  - Users are informed (if necessary) that remote data is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Implement Retry Logic**\n- Sometimes, 404 errors can be temporary due to network issues or GitHub rate limiting.\n- Add a retry mechanism (e.g., 2–3 retries with exponential backoff) before falling back to samples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Cache Remote Data Locally**\n- If the remote data does not change frequently, cache it locally after a successful fetch.\n- On subsequent runs, use the cached version if the remote fetch fails.\n- Periodically refresh the cache (e.g., daily or weekly).\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Monitor and Alert**\n- Set up monitoring to detect when remote fetches fail.\n- Send alerts (e.g., email, Slack) if the remote data is unavailable for an extended period.\n- This helps you respond quickly if the issue is due to a change in the remote repository.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Document and Version Dependencies**\n- Document the expected location and format of remote data.\n- If possible, version the data files (e.g., `horizon_sample_v1.json`) to avoid breaking changes.\n- Use a specific commit hash or tag in the URL instead of `main` to ensure stability:\n  - Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/abc123/horizon_sample.json`\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Contact the Repository Maintainers**\n- If the files are missing and should be there, open an issue on the repository to request their restoration or clarification.\n- Provide details about your use case and the impact of the missing files.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Consider Alternative Data Sources**\n- If the remote data is unreliable, consider hosting your own copy of the files (e.g., in your own repository or cloud storage).\n- Ensure you have the right to redistribute the data.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Improve Error Handling and Logging**\n- Enhance error messages to include:\n  - The exact URL that failed.\n  - The HTTP status code and response.\n  - The timestamp and context (e.g., which part of the code triggered the fetch).\n- This makes debugging easier and helps identify patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Automate Data Validation**\n- After fetching remote data, validate its structure and content.\n- If the data is invalid or incomplete, fall back to samples or raise an alert.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mitigation Code (Python-like Pseudocode)\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport time\n\ndef fetch_remote_data(url, fallback_data, max_retries=3):\n    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n            if response.status_code == 200:\n                return response.json()\n            else:\n                print(f\"Remote fetch failed: {response.status_code} for {url}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Exception during fetch: {e}\")\n        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff\n    print(\"Falling back to samples.\")\n    return fallback_data\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Verify URLs and file existence.**\n- **Use fallbacks and retries.**\n- **Cache data locally.**\n- **Monitor and alert on failures.**\n- **Document and version dependencies.**\n- **Contact maintainers if needed.**\n- **Improve error handling and logging.**\n\nBy implementing these mitigations, you can make your application more resilient to remote data fetch failures and ensure a better user experience.",
