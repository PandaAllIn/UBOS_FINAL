    "summary": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the requests are failing with a **404 Not Found** error.",
    "content": "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a GitHub repository (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the requests are failing with a **404 Not Found** error. This means the files are either missing, moved, or the URLs are incorrect.\n\nHere are several **mitigations and best practices** to address and prevent such issues in the future:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**\n- **Action:** Double-check the URLs to ensure they are correct and that the files actually exist in the repository.\n- **How to check:**\n  - Open the URLs directly in your browser:\n    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n  - If you get a 404, the files are not present in the repository.\n- **Mitigation:** If the files are missing, contact the repository owner or check the repository’s documentation for updated file locations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Handle 404 Errors Gracefully in Code**\n- **Action:** Implement error handling in your code to manage cases where remote fetches fail.\n- **Example (Python):**\n  ```python\n  import requests\n\n  def fetch_json(url):\n      try:\n          response = requests.get(url)\n          response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses\n          return response.json()\n      except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n          if e.response.status_code == 404:\n              print(f\"File not found: {url}. Falling back to local samples.\")\n              return load_local_samples()  # Your fallback logic\n          else:\n              raise e\n      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n          print(f\"Request failed: {e}\")\n          return load_local_samples()\n\n  def load_local_samples():\n      # Load your local sample data\n      pass\n  ```\n- **Benefit:** This ensures your application continues to function even if remote resources are unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Use Fallback Mechanisms**\n- **Action:** Always have a fallback mechanism, such as local sample data or cached versions of the files.\n- **How to implement:**\n  - Store sample data locally in your project.\n  - Use the local data if the remote fetch fails.\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  def get_data(url, fallback_path):\n      try:\n          return fetch_json(url)\n      except:\n          print(\"Using local fallback data.\")\n          with open(fallback_path, 'r') as f:\n              return json.load(f)\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monitor and Update URLs Regularly**\n- **Action:** Periodically check the URLs to ensure they are still valid.\n- **How to implement:**\n  - Set up automated tests or scripts to verify the availability of remote resources.\n  - Update your code or configuration if URLs change.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Check Repository Documentation and Issues**\n- **Action:** Review the repository’s README, documentation, or issue tracker for any announcements about file removals or changes.\n- **How to check:**\n  - Visit the repository: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets\n  - Look for any notes about file deprecation or new locations.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Consider Using a More Reliable Data Source**\n- **Action:** If the repository is frequently changing or unreliable, consider finding a more stable data source.\n- **How to implement:**\n  - Look for official datasets or APIs that provide the required data.\n  - Mirror the data in your own repository or cloud storage for reliability.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Cache Remote Data Locally**\n- **Action:** Cache the fetched data locally to reduce dependency on remote availability.\n- **How to implement:**\n  - Save the fetched JSON files to a local directory.\n  - Use the cached files if the remote fetch fails.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Notify Repository Maintainers**\n- **Action:** If you believe the files should be available, open an issue on the repository to notify the maintainers.\n- **How to do it:**\n  - Go to the repository’s issues page: https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets/issues\n  - Create a new issue describing the problem and requesting the files to be restored or updated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Verify URLs and file existence.**\n- **Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.**\n- **Monitor and update URLs regularly.**\n- **Use local caching and fallback data.**\n- **Check repository documentation and issues.**\n- **Consider more reliable data sources if necessary.**\n- **Notify maintainers if files are missing.**\n\nBy following these mitigations, you can make your application more resilient to remote resource failures and ensure a better user experience.",
