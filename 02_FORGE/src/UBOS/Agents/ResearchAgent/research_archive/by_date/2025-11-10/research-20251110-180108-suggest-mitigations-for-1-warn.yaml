  content: "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from\
    \ GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing your system to fall back\
    \ to local sample data. This means the files at these URLs do not exist or are\
    \ inaccessible.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n\
    1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets`\
    \ under the `main` branch and the `main` folder. A 404 error typically means the\
    \ file is missing or the path is incorrect.  \n   - Check for typos or case sensitivity\
    \ issues in the file names and paths, as GitHub URLs are case-sensitive[2][3].\n\
    \n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is\
    \ public or accessible with the credentials you are using. Private repositories\
    \ or restricted access can cause 404 errors[6].  \n   - Confirm that the branch\
    \ `main` is the correct branch where the files reside. If the default branch changed,\
    \ update the URLs accordingly.\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n \
    \  - If the files were deleted or moved, restore them to the expected location\
    \ or update your fetch URLs to point to the new location.  \n   - If you control\
    \ the repository, commit and push the missing files to the correct path.\n\n4.\
    \ **Use Alternative Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   - If the files are no longer\
    \ available remotely, consider hosting them on a reliable server or CDN you control.\
    \  \n   - Alternatively, maintain local copies within your project to avoid remote\
    \ fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks**  \n   - Since\
    \ your system already falls back to sample data, ensure this fallback is robust\
    \ and clearly logged for troubleshooting.  \n   - Optionally, implement retries\
    \ or alternative URLs if the primary fetch fails.\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Confirm\
    \ Deployment**  \n   - If the files were recently added or updated, clear any\
    \ caches or CDN caches that might cause stale 404 errors[1].  \n   - If using\
    \ GitHub Pages or similar, ensure the site is rebuilt and published correctly[1][4].\n\
    \n7. **Monitor GitHub Status and Logs**  \n   - Check GitHub's status page for\
    \ any ongoing incidents that might affect file availability[1].  \n   - Review\
    \ any build or fetch logs for additional clues.\n\nBy verifying file existence,\
    \ correcting URLs, ensuring repository accessibility, and maintaining reliable\
    \ fallbacks, you can mitigate these 404 fetch warnings effectively."
  key_insights:
  - confidence: 1.1
    insight: Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually
      exist in the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets` under
      the `main` branch and the `main` folder. A 404 error typically means the file
      is missing or the path is incorrect.
