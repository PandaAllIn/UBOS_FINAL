    "content": "The warnings you see indicate that the remote fetch of JSON files from GitHub URLs failed with a 404 Not Found error, causing your system to fall back to local sample data. This means the files at these URLs do not exist or are inaccessible.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   - Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets` under the `main` branch and the `main` folder. A 404 error typically means the file is missing or the path is incorrect.  \n   - Check for typos or case sensitivity issues in the file names and paths, as GitHub URLs are case-sensitive[2][3].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   - Ensure the repository is public or accessible with the credentials you are using. Private repositories or restricted access can cause 404 errors[6].  \n   - Confirm that the branch `main` is the correct branch where the files reside. If the default branch changed, update the URLs accordingly.\n\n3. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   - If the files were deleted or moved, restore them to the expected location or update your fetch URLs to point to the new location.  \n   - If you control the repository, commit and push the missing files to the correct path.\n\n4. **Use Alternative Hosting or Local Copies**  \n   - If the files are no longer available remotely, consider hosting them on a reliable server or CDN you control.  \n   - Alternatively, maintain local copies within your project to avoid remote fetch failures.\n\n5. **Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks**  \n   - Since your system already falls back to sample data, ensure this fallback is robust and clearly logged for troubleshooting.  \n   - Optionally, implement retries or alternative URLs if the primary fetch fails.\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Confirm Deployment**  \n   - If the files were recently added or updated, clear any caches or CDN caches that might cause stale 404 errors[1].  \n   - If using GitHub Pages or similar, ensure the site is rebuilt and published correctly[1][4].\n\n7. **Monitor GitHub Status and Logs**  \n   - Check GitHub's status page for any ongoing incidents that might affect file availability[1].  \n   - Review any build or fetch logs for additional clues.\n\nBy verifying file existence, correcting URLs, ensuring repository accessibility, and maintaining reliable fallbacks, you can mitigate these 404 fetch warnings effectively.",
