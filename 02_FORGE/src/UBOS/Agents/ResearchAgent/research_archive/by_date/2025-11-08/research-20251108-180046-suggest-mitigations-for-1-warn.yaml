  content: "The warnings indicate that remote fetches for two JSON files from GitHub\
    \ URLs are failing with 404 errors, meaning the files are not found at the specified\
    \ URLs. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify\
    \ the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json`\
    \ and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the GitHub repository at the specified\
    \ paths (`ubos-ai/datasets/main/`). A 404 error typically means the files are\
    \ missing, renamed, moved, or deleted[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch\
    \ Settings**  \n   Ensure the repository is public (if using GitHub Pages or public\
    \ fetch) and the branch (`main`) is correct. If the repository was recently made\
    \ private or the branch changed, the files may not be accessible[5][7].\n\n3.\
    \ **Confirm Case Sensitivity and Path Accuracy**  \n   GitHub URLs and file paths\
    \ are case-sensitive. Double-check the exact casing of filenames and directory\
    \ names to avoid mismatches causing 404 errors[2][4].\n\n4. **Update or Restore\
    \ Missing Files**  \n   If the files were accidentally deleted or moved, restore\
    \ them to the correct location or update the URLs in your code to point to the\
    \ new location.\n\n5. **Use a Reliable Hosting or Mirror**  \n   If the files\
    \ are critical and the GitHub repository is unstable, consider hosting the files\
    \ on a more reliable or permanent storage service or maintain an internal mirror\
    \ to avoid fetch failures.\n\n6. **Implement Fallback and Error Handling**  \n\
    \   Since your system already falls back to samples, ensure this fallback is robust\
    \ and clearly logged. Consider alerting or notifying maintainers when remote fetches\
    \ fail to prompt timely fixes.\n\n7. **Automate Link Validation**  \n   Regularly\
    \ scan your codebase for broken links or 404 errors on remote dependencies to\
    \ proactively detect and fix issues before deployment[3].\n\n8. **Clear Browser\
    \ or Cache Issues (if applicable)**  \n   If the fetch is done via a browser or\
    \ client that caches responses, clear caches or test in incognito mode to rule\
    \ out stale cache causing 404 errors[1][7].\n\nBy following these mitigations,\
    \ you can reduce the occurrence of 404 fetch errors and improve the reliability\
    \ of your data retrieval from GitHub-hosted resources."
