    "content": "The warnings indicate that remote fetches for two JSON files from GitHub URLs are failing with 404 errors, meaning the files are not found at the specified URLs. To mitigate these issues, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the URLs and File Existence**  \n   Confirm that the files `horizon_sample.json` and `erdf_sample.json` actually exist in the GitHub repository at the specified paths (`ubos-ai/datasets/main/`). A 404 error typically means the files are missing, renamed, moved, or deleted[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Check Repository and Branch Settings**  \n   Ensure the repository is public (if using GitHub Pages or public fetch) and the branch (`main`) is correct. If the repository was recently made private or the branch changed, the files may not be accessible[5][7].\n\n3. **Confirm Case Sensitivity and Path Accuracy**  \n   GitHub URLs and file paths are case-sensitive. Double-check the exact casing of filenames and directory names to avoid mismatches causing 404 errors[2][4].\n\n4. **Update or Restore Missing Files**  \n   If the files were accidentally deleted or moved, restore them to the correct location or update the URLs in your code to point to the new location.\n\n5. **Use a Reliable Hosting or Mirror**  \n   If the files are critical and the GitHub repository is unstable, consider hosting the files on a more reliable or permanent storage service or maintain an internal mirror to avoid fetch failures.\n\n6. **Implement Fallback and Error Handling**  \n   Since your system already falls back to samples, ensure this fallback is robust and clearly logged. Consider alerting or notifying maintainers when remote fetches fail to prompt timely fixes.\n\n7. **Automate Link Validation**  \n   Regularly scan your codebase for broken links or 404 errors on remote dependencies to proactively detect and fix issues before deployment[3].\n\n8. **Clear Browser or Cache Issues (if applicable)**  \n   If the fetch is done via a browser or client that caches responses, clear caches or test in incognito mode to rule out stale cache causing 404 errors[1][7].\n\nBy following these mitigations, you can reduce the occurrence of 404 fetch errors and improve the reliability of your data retrieval from GitHub-hosted resources.",
