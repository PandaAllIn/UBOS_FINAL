  content: "The warnings you are encountering indicate that your application or script\
    \ is attempting to fetch two specific JSON files from a public GitHub repository\
    \ (`ubos-ai/datasets`), but the URLs are returning a **404 Not Found** error.\
    \ This means the files do not exist at the specified locations.\n\nHere are **mitigations\
    \ and best practices** for handling such remote fetch failures due to 404 errors:\n\
    \n---\n\n### 1. **Verify File Existence and URL Correctness**\n- **Check the URLs\
    \ directly in your browser**:\n  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/horizon_sample.json\n\
    \  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/main/erdf_sample.json\n\
    - If these URLs return 404, the files are missing or have been moved/renamed.\n\
    - **Mitigation**: \n  - Visit the GitHub repository (https://github.com/ubos-ai/datasets)\
    \ and confirm if the files exist and are in the correct branch (`main`).\n  -\
    \ If the files have been moved or renamed, update your code to use the correct\
    \ URLs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Implement Graceful Fallbacks**\n- Your system is already\
    \ falling back to local samples, which is good.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Ensure\
    \ fallback logic is robust and well-documented.\n  - Log the fallback event for\
    \ monitoring and debugging.\n  - Consider notifying developers or admins when\
    \ fallbacks occur frequently.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Handle Errors Gracefully in Code**\n\
    - Wrap remote fetches in try-catch blocks or equivalent error handling.\n- **Mitigation**:\n\
    \  - Retry the fetch a few times (with exponential backoff) in case of transient\
    \ network issues.\n  - If the file is critical, fail fast and notify the user/admin.\n\
    \  - If the file is optional, proceed with fallback data.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monitor\
    \ and Alert**\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Set up monitoring for 404 errors on remote\
    \ fetches.\n  - Alert developers when remote resources are unavailable for an\
    \ extended period.\n  - Use tools like GitHub Actions, cron jobs, or external\
    \ monitoring services to periodically check the availability of these URLs.\n\n\
    ---\n\n### 5. **Cache Remote Data Locally**\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Cache the\
    \ remote JSON files locally when they are successfully fetched.\n  - Use the cached\
    \ version if the remote fetch fails.\n  - Implement a cache invalidation strategy\
    \ (e.g., refresh cache every X hours).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Use Versioned or Stable\
    \ URLs**\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - If possible, use versioned URLs or specific commit\
    \ hashes instead of the `main` branch.\n  - Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubos-ai/datasets/commit-hash/horizon_sample.json`\n\
    \  - This ensures that the file remains available even if the `main` branch changes.\n\
    \n---\n\n### 7. **Contact Repository Maintainers**\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - If\
    \ the files are supposed to be there, open an issue on the GitHub repository to\
    \ notify the maintainers.\n  - Provide details about the missing files and their\
    \ importance.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Document Dependencies**\n- **Mitigation**:\n\
    \  - Document all remote dependencies and their expected URLs.\n  - Include instructions\
    \ for updating URLs if files are moved or renamed.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Automate\
    \ Redirects or URL Updates**\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - If the repository uses redirects\
    \ or has a predictable pattern for file locations, implement logic to automatically\
    \ update URLs or follow redirects.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Security Considerations**\n\
    - **Mitigation**:\n  - Ensure that fallback data is sanitized and does not introduce\
    \ security vulnerabilities.\n  - Avoid exposing sensitive information in fallback\
    \ data.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Mitigation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n\
    | Verify URLs | Check if files exist at the specified URLs. |\n| Graceful Fallbacks\
    \ | Use local samples if remote fetch fails. |\n| Error Handling | Wrap fetches\
    \ in try-catch blocks. |\n| Monitoring | Alert on persistent 404 errors. |\n|\
    \ Local Caching | Cache remote data locally. |\n| Versioned URLs | Use commit\
    \ hashes for stability. |\n| Contact Maintainers | Notify if files are missing.\
    \ |\n| Document Dependencies | Keep a record of remote dependencies. |\n| Automate\
    \ Redirects | Update URLs automatically if possible. |\n| Security | Sanitize\
    \ fallback data. |\n\n---\n\nBy implementing these mitigations, you can ensure\
    \ that your application remains robust and user-friendly even when remote resources\
    \ are unavailable."
