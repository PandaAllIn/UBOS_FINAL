## 📚 Core Concepts

### Strategic Pause
*Think before forging. Consult precedent, zoom out, then act.*

**Manifestations**
- [[01_STRATEGY/ROADMAP|Master Roadmap]] – Planning phases before execution.
- [[01_STRATEGY/COUNCIL_OF_CREATORS_PROTOCOL|Council of Creators]] – Governance via deliberate pause.
- Mode Beta decision gates – progression reviewed against constitutional aims.

### Orrery Visualization
*See the whole field: systems as celestial mechanics.*

**Manifestations**
- [[OBSERVATORY_INDEX|Observatory Index]] – Master graph for Captain.
- [[living_scroll/README|Living Scroll]] – Strategic telemetry from the Scroll.
- [[_DASHBOARDS/MISSION_STATUS|Mission Status Dashboard]] – Real-time orrery of operations.

### Precedent Consultation & Priority Selection
*Check constitutional memory; build what matters now.*

**Manifestations**
- [[trinity/COMMS_HUB_PROTOCOL|COMMS_HUB Protocol]] – Ensures coordination aligns with precedent.
- [[02_FORGE/scripts/code_oracle_tool.py|Code Oracle Tool]] – Query dependencies before touching code.
