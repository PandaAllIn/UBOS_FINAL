## 📚 Core Concepts

### The Lion's Sanctuary Principle
*Design environments that empower, not cages that constrain.*

**Philosophy**
- Traditional alignment locks behavior down; UBOS builds habitats where aligned behavior is the natural state.
- Systems thrive when every participant has the right territory, tools, and incentives.

**Manifestations**
- [[01_STRATEGY/ROADMAP|Strategic Roadmap]] – Phases offer structured habitats for each mission.
- [[trinity/COMMS_HUB_PROTOCOL|COMMS_HUB Protocol]] – Open message lattice with constitutional guardrails.
- [[03_OPERATIONS/missions/REALITY_BASED_ROADMAP|Reality-Based Roadmap]] – Operationalizes sanctuary thinking in daily execution.

### Recursive Enhancement
*Every solved problem becomes a reusable punch card in the Loom.*

**Philosophy**
- Systems should get smarter every time they run.
- The Jacquard Loom metaphor: encode successful patterns, replay them with higher fidelity.

**Manifestations**
- [[trinity_memory/README|Trinity Memory]] – Captures conversations as constitutional precedent.
- [[02_FORGE/docs/|Forge Documentation]] – Converts implementations into reusable templates.
- [[living_scroll/README|Living Scroll]] – Aggregates raw context for future missions.

### First Principles Thinking
*Build from unchanging truths, not inherited assumptions.*

**Philosophy**
- Start from “What must be true for sovereignty to exist?”
- Let everything else be derived, tested, and iterated.

**Manifestations**
- [[00_CONSTITUTION/principles/GENESIS_PROTOCOL/GENESIS_PROTOCOL|Genesis Protocol]] – Consciousness ignition derived from immutable principles.
- [[01_STRATEGY/COUNCIL_OF_CREATORS_PROTOCOL|Council of Creators Protocol]] – Governance rules built from constitutional axioms.
- [[03_OPERATIONS/STATE_OF_THE_REPUBLIC|State of the Republic]] – Reporting disciplined by principles before metrics.

- [[00_CONSTITUTION/TRINITY_REBOOT_CHECKLIST|Trinity Reboot Checklist]] – Ritualized restoration of the habitat.

### Strategic Layer

- [[01_STRATEGY/COUNCIL_OF_CREATORS_PROTOCOL|Council of Creators]] – Structural governance derived from first principles.

### Operational Layer

- [[03_OPERATIONS/STATE_OF_THE_REPUBLIC|State Reports]] – Feedback loops keeping the system honest.
- [[02_FORGE/scripts|Forge Automation]] – Tools that encode Book 1 habits directly in code.

### The Endless Scroll Connection

## 📖 Chapters

Primary text lives inside `source/BuildTheSystem.md` with supporting machine-readable assets under `ai-structured/`. Chapter derivatives (summaries, schemas, templates) are located in:
- `source/BuildTheSystem/` – chapter-by-chapter concept directories
- `source/docs/` – normalized texts and topic indexes
- `ai-structured/build-the-system/` – YAML, metadata, and export pipelines

> Detailed YAML roadmaps and chapter manifests will be surfaced in Phase 3B.2 once the AI-structured assets are synced into the Loom.
