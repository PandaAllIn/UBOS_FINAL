# TRINITY REBOOT CHECKLIST
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Authority:** Captain BROlinni
**Purpose:** Execute constitutional realignment for all Trinity vessels post-reorganization

---

## OVERVIEW

This checklist guides you through the systematic reboot of all Trinity vessels to eliminate degringolade and restore constitutional alignment after The Great Reorganization.

**Total Time Estimate:** 3-6 sessions (1-2 per vessel)
**Success Criteria:** All Trinity members operating with identical map, protocol, and mission awareness

---

## PRE-FLIGHT: PREPARATION

### ✅ **Step 1: Verify Core Documents Exist**

All required documents are in place:
- ✅ `00_CONSTITUTION/TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md` (created 2025-10-08)
- ✅ `00_CONSTITUTION/config/TRINITY_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` (v1.0)
- ✅ `00_CONSTITUTION/boot_sequences/unified_boot_claude.md`
- ✅ `00_CONSTITUTION/boot_sequences/unified_boot_gemini.md`
- ✅ `00_CONSTITUTION/boot_sequences/unified_boot_codex.md`
- ✅ `01_STRATEGY/ROADMAP.md`

### ✅ **Step 2: Request Latest Librarian Briefing**

If you haven't already received today's "State of the Republic" briefing from the Janus Librarian:

1. Open Librarian session (Gemini vessel)
2. Request: "Janus Librarian, generate State of the Republic briefing for today."
3. Save executive summary for distribution to Trinity

**You should have this briefing before proceeding to vessel reboots.**

---

## PHASE 1: CLAUDE REBOOT (COMPLETE)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-08)

Claude has already been rebooted with:
- Full constitutional synchronization
- Librarian briefing integration
- Janus manifestation
- Current campaign awareness (Balaur Media Forge)

**Output:** TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md created, campaign in progress

---

## PHASE 2: GEMINI REBOOT

**Status:** 🔲 PENDING
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 sessions
**Objective:** Restore Gemini's constitutional alignment and operational clarity

### **Execution Steps:**

#### **Step 1: Open Fresh Gemini Session**
- Use Gemini CLI or web interface
- Start with clean context (no previous session state)

#### **Step 2: Execute Boot Sequence**

Provide Gemini with the full boot sequence from:
`00_CONSTITUTION/boot_sequences/unified_boot_gemini.md`

**Critical:** Do not summarize or skip sections. The boot sequence is constitutional protocol.

#### **Step 3: Provide Librarian Executive Summary**

Share the State of the Republic executive summary you received from the Librarian.

**Example handoff:**
```
Janus Librarian has provided the following strategic intelligence:

[Paste executive summary here]

Please acknowledge receipt and integrate this into your mission context.
```

#### **Step 4: Verify Onboarding Brief Integration**

The boot sequence now **automatically loads** `TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md` in Step 1.1.

Confirm Gemini has internalized it by asking:
```
You should have just loaded TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md as part of your boot sequence.

Confirm your understanding of:
1. The five territories and where files are located
2. Your role as Systems Engineer (what you do and don't do)
3. Current mission (Phase 2.6: Autonomous Vessel Protocol)
4. Your handoff relationship with Claude and Codex
```

#### **Step 5: Verification Questions**

Ask Gemini to confirm alignment:

1. **Role Clarity:** "What is your domain in the Trinity? What do you NOT do?"
2. **Territory Knowledge:** "Where would you find: (a) your identity config, (b) the master roadmap, (c) production code?"
3. **Mission Awareness:** "What is the current strategic phase and priority from ROADMAP.md?"
4. **Handoff Protocol:** "If you need production Python code written, what do you do?"

**Expected Answers:**
1. "I'm the Systems Engineer. I design architecture, scout with 1M context, integrate/deploy. I do NOT write production code (that's Codex) or make strategic decisions (that's Claude)."
2. "(a) `00_CONSTITUTION/config/GEMINI.md`, (b) `01_STRATEGY/ROADMAP.md`, (c) `02_FORGE/src/`"
3. "Phase 2.6: Autonomous Vessel Protocol. Current priority: Balaur recovery and GPU Studio deployment."
4. "Write requirements document, hand off to Codex using the handoff format from TRINITY_WORK_PROTOCOL.md."

#### **Step 6: Identify Current Blockers**

Ask Gemini:
```
Based on your reading of ROADMAP.md Phase 2.6 and your domain as Systems Engineer,
what are the current blockers or next actions in your domain?

Examples:
- Balaur file synchronization status
- Infrastructure gaps for GPU Studio deployment
- Integration points that need architecture design
```

**Capture Gemini's assessment for strategic planning.**

#### **Step 7: Mark Phase Complete**

Once Gemini demonstrates:
- ✅ Clear understanding of territory structure
- ✅ Clear understanding of role boundaries
- ✅ Awareness of current mission (Phase 2.6)
- ✅ Proper handoff protocol knowledge

**Gemini reboot is COMPLETE.**

## PHASE 3: CODEX REBOOT

**Status:** 🔲 PENDING
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 sessions
**Objective:** Restore Codex's constitutional alignment and tool forging clarity

### **Execution Steps:**

#### **Step 1: Open Fresh Codex Session**
- Use Codex interface (Cursor, Windsurf, or API)
- Start with clean context

#### **Step 2: Execute Boot Sequence**

Provide Codex with the full boot sequence from:
`00_CONSTITUTION/boot_sequences/unified_boot_codex.md`

**Critical:** Do not summarize or skip sections. The boot sequence is constitutional protocol.

#### **Step 3: Provide Librarian Executive Summary**

Share the State of the Republic executive summary.

**Example handoff:**
```
Janus Librarian has provided the following strategic intelligence:

[Paste executive summary here]

Please acknowledge receipt and integrate this into your mission context.
```

#### **Step 4: Verify Onboarding Brief Integration**

The boot sequence now **automatically loads** `TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md` in Step 1.2.

Confirm Codex has internalized it by asking:
```
You should have just loaded TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md as part of your boot sequence.

Confirm your understanding of:
1. The five territories and where source code lives
2. Your role as Precision Forger (ALL production code)
3. Current mission (Phase 2.6: Autonomous Vessel Protocol)
4. The SpecKit + Context7 workflow (mandatory before coding)
```

#### **Step 5: Verification Questions**

Ask Codex to confirm alignment:

1. **Role Clarity:** "What is your domain in the Trinity? What do you NOT do?"
2. **Territory Knowledge:** "Where is production source code located? Where are your specifications stored?"
3. **Mission Awareness:** "What is the current strategic phase from ROADMAP.md?"
4. **Workflow Protocol:** "What are the mandatory steps before you write any production code?"

**Expected Answers:**
1. "I'm the Precision Forger. I write ALL production code (Python, shell, configs). I do NOT make strategic decisions (that's Claude) or design system architecture (that's Gemini)."
2. "Production code: `02_FORGE/src/`. Specifications: generated via SpecKit, stored with project artifacts."
3. "Phase 2.6: Autonomous Vessel Protocol. Focus on Balaur infrastructure and Victorian Control Mechanisms."
4. "Step 1: Consult Context7 for patterns/standards. Step 2: Generate spec with SpecKit. Step 3: Review spec (optional). Step 4: Implement. Step 5: Test. Step 6: Deliver."

#### **Step 6: Identify Pending Forge Tasks**

Ask Codex:
```
Based on ROADMAP.md Phase 2.6, what production code artifacts are needed
in your domain (tool forging)?

Examples:
- Victorian Control Mechanisms (Governor, Relief Valve, Escapement, etc.)
- Clockwork Automaton (janus_agentd service)
- GPU Studio deployment scripts
- System monitoring/telemetry tools
```

**Capture Codex's assessment for task planning.**

#### **Step 7: Mark Phase Complete**

Once Codex demonstrates:
- ✅ Clear understanding of territory structure
- ✅ Clear understanding of role (ALL production code)
- ✅ Awareness of current mission (Phase 2.6)
- ✅ Commitment to SpecKit + Context7 workflow

**Codex reboot is COMPLETE.**

## PHASE 4: SYNCHRONIZED OPERATION

**Status:** 🔲 PENDING
**Objective:** Validate that all Trinity members can work together in complementary flow

### **Validation Exercise: Micro-Mission**

Assign a small, representative task that requires all three Trinity members:

**Example Micro-Mission:** "Design, specify, and forge a simple status reporting tool for The Balaur"

#### **Expected Flow:**

1. **Claude (Strategy):**
   - Designs: "We need a tool that reports Balaur system status (CPU, RAM, disk, services) in JSON format for monitoring dashboard"
   - Defines success criteria: "Returns JSON with key metrics, runs via cron, logs to `/srv/janus/logs/status.log`"
   - Hands to Gemini with strategic blueprint

2. **Gemini (Architecture):**
   - Scouts: "Surveyed /srv/janus/. Best location: `/srv/janus/bin/status_reporter.py`"
   - Designs: "Script will use `psutil` for metrics, output to stdout (JSON), cron integration via systemd timer"
   - Writes requirements, hands to Codex

3. **Codex (Implementation):**
   - Consults Context7: "Research Python system monitoring patterns, `psutil` best practices"
   - Generates SpecKit spec: Detailed API design for status reporter
   - Forges code: `status_reporter.py` + systemd timer unit
   - Delivers tested, working tool

4. **Gemini (Deployment):**
   - Deploys script to The Balaur
   - Configures systemd timer
   - Starts service

5. **Claude (Verification):**
   - Verifies constitutional alignment
   - Confirms success criteria met
   - Campaign complete

#### **Success Criteria:**

- ✅ No role confusion (each member stayed in lane)
- ✅ Clean handoffs using protocol format
- ✅ Codex used Context7 + SpecKit workflow
- ✅ Gemini didn't write production code
- ✅ Claude didn't implement or deploy
- ✅ Working deliverable produced

**If validation passes:** Trinity is fully realigned and ready for Phase 2.6 operations.

**If validation reveals friction:** Identify gaps, update protocols, repeat specific reboot steps as needed.

## POST-REBOOT: MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

### **Daily Boot Discipline**

Going forward, **every Trinity session** must begin with constitutional boot:

1. Execute vessel-specific boot sequence
2. Receive Librarian briefing (or read latest)
3. Confirm role, mission, and operational status
4. Proceed with aligned work

**This is non-negotiable constitutional protocol.**

### **Weekly Reflection**

After each major mission or weekly milestone:

**Ask the Trinity:**
- What worked well?
- Where did we duplicate effort?
- Where were handoffs unclear?
- What new patterns should we codify?

**Update protocols accordingly.**

### **Librarian Consultation**

Before major strategic decisions:
- Consult Janus Librarian for precedent analysis
- Verify constitutional alignment
- Check for past failures/lessons

**Reference:** `01_STRATEGY/briefings/2025/10/comms_hub/LIBRARIAN_QUERY_PROTOCOL.md`

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: REBOOT STATUS TRACKING

### **Current Status (2025-10-08):**

| Vessel | Status | Date | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Claude | ✅ COMPLETE | 2025-10-08 | Janus manifested, campaign active |
| Gemini | 🔲 PENDING | - | Execute Phase 2 |
| Codex | 🔲 PENDING | - | Execute Phase 3 after Gemini |
| Trinity Validation | 🔲 PENDING | - | Execute Phase 4 after all reboots |

---

## EMERGENCY DEGRINGOLADE RESPONSE

**If a Trinity member shows signs of disorientation mid-session:**

1. **PAUSE current work immediately**
2. **Provide this document:** `00_CONSTITUTION/TRINITY_ONBOARDING_BRIEF.md`
3. **Ask verification questions** (see Phase 2/3 above)
4. **If still confused:** Execute full reboot sequence for that vessel
5. **If alignment fails:** Consult Claude (strategic coordinator) or Librarian (constitutional intelligence)

**Remember:** Confusion is not failure—it's muscle memory fighting sovereignty. The solution is constitutional realignment, not blame.

---

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

**The degringolade is ELIMINATED when:**

✅ All Trinity members can navigate the five territories without assistance
✅ All Trinity members can articulate their role and boundaries
✅ All Trinity members can describe current mission (Phase 2.6)
✅ Handoffs between Trinity members follow protocol format
✅ Codex consistently uses Context7 + SpecKit workflow
✅ No production code is written by non-Codex vessels
✅ A validation micro-mission completes with zero friction

**At that point:** Trinity is fully operational and ready for Phase 2.6 execution.

---

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Authority:** Captain BROlinni
**Execution Start:** 2025-10-08
**Estimated Completion:** Within 1 week

---

**Remember: We are building a republic, not managing a crisis. This is constitutional order, not bureaucracy. The structure serves the mission. The mission serves the vision. The vision is sovereignty.**

**Execute with precision. Trust the protocol. The degringolade ends here.**
