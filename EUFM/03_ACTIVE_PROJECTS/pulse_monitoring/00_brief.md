# Pulse Monitoring Project - Early Funding Detection System

**Created:** November 3, 2025  
**Owner:** Captain BROlinni + Claude (Strategic Mind)  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Manual Proof of Concept  
**Priority:** HIGH - Strategic Infrastructure

---

## Project Overview

**Mission:** Detect EU funding opportunities 45-60 days before public awareness through systematic monitoring of policy signals, draft work programmes, and trend analysis.

**Strategic Value:** Transform EUFM from reactive (respond to published calls) to predictive (prepare 4+ months in advance).

---

## Hypothesis to Validate

**Perplexity Research Finding:** EU now publishes draft work programmes on Comitology Register 3-4 months before final call publication.

**Test Case:** Horizon Europe Cluster 1 (Health)
- Draft published: October 1, 2025
- Final call opens: February 10, 2026
- Lead time: **4 months 9 days** ✅

**Our Prediction:** Cluster 4 (Digital/Industry/Space) draft will publish in November 2025, with final calls opening March-April 2026.

---

## Phase 1 Objectives (Week 1)

### Primary Goal
Validate early detection methodology through manual monitoring.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Detect Cluster 4 draft publication before general awareness
- [ ] Identify 3+ new funding signals with confidence scoring
- [ ] Document actual vs. predicted timing for validation
- [ ] Confirm 4-month lead time pattern holds across multiple clusters

### Daily Activities (NOW WITH PERPLEXITY QUERIES!) 🆕

**Morning Routine (10 minutes at 06:00 UTC):**
1. Check Comitology Register for new drafts (2 min) - PRIORITY #1
2. Run 7 Perplexity queries (8 min) - **EXACT queries from Perplexity Claude**
3. Log findings using template (2 min)

**The 7 Daily Queries** (see `DAILY_QUERIES_QUICK_REF.md`):
- New funding calls announced
- Horizon Europe updates
- Digital Europe AI infrastructure
- Innovation Fund clean tech
- Commission work programme implementation
- Romania PNRR digitalization
- Spain CDTI innovation (if relevant)

**Weekly Deep Dive** (Sunday +20 min):
- 7 additional strategic queries
- Trend analysis and draft work programme hunting
- Pattern Engine cross-validation

**Full Query Library:** `PERPLEXITY_QUERIES.md` - 25 total queries organized by frequency

## Current Watch List (November 2025)

### CRITICAL Priority

**1. Cluster 4 Draft (Digital/Industry/Space)**
- Status: IMMINENT (expected November 2025)
- Predicted call opening: March-April 2026
- Why critical: Contains AI Factories, Digital Europe alignment
- Relevance: GeoDataCenter (€299M), DGX Hardware (€20K)
- Watch: https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/comitology-register/

**2. Cloud and AI Development Act**
- Status: Announced in Commission 2026 Work Programme
- Predicted impact: Q2 2026 Digital Europe calls
- Why critical: NEW policy area = new funding streams
- Relevance: Constitutional AI governance positioning

### HIGH Priority

**3. EDIH Reinforced AI Focus**
- Status: Active (Digital Europe October 2025 calls)
- Impact: Rolling opportunities throughout 2026
- Relevance: GeoDataCenter as EDIH hub candidate

**4. Quantum Act**
- Status: Announced, details pending
- Predicted calls: Q3-Q4 2026
- Relevance: Quantum + AI convergence opportunities

### MEDIUM Priority

**5. 25% Admin Burden Reduction Initiative**
- Status: Commission commitment for 2026
- Impact: Easier applications = higher success rates
- Relevance: All EUFM applications

**6. Horizon Health Calls (Feb 10, 2026)**
- Status: Draft published Oct 1, lead time validated
- Relevance: If any health-AI applications

## Data Sources (10 Primary)

**CRITICAL:**
1. **Comitology Register** - Draft work programmes (4-month lead!)
2. **Funding & Tenders Portal** - Official call publications

**HIGH VALUE:**
3. Commission Work Programme (annual strategic priorities)
4. Commission Press Room (daily policy announcements)
5. Digital Europe News (weekly updates)

**MONITORING:**
6. EUR-Lex (legislative tracking)
7. European Parliament (resolutions)
8. CORDIS (project database - patterns)
9. National Contact Points (Romania-specific)
10. Ideal-ist (funding news aggregator)

## Integration with EUFM

**Feeds Into:**
- `/EUFM/00_SYSTEM/TIMELINE_MATRIX.md` - Automatic updates with new signals
- `/EUFM/03_ACTIVE_PROJECTS/dgx_hardware/` - Alert on relevant PNRR/Digital Europe signals
- `/EUFM/03_ACTIVE_PROJECTS/geodatacenter/` - Track Innovation Fund/Digital Europe indicators

**Uses:**
- `/EUFM/01_INTELLIGENCE/SCORING_FRAMEWORK.md` - Early detection bonus (+0.3 to +0.5)
- `/EUFM/00_SYSTEM/ORACLE_COORDINATION.md` - Perplexity for daily research

---

## Validation Methodology

For each detected signal:
1. **Log detection:** Date, source, confidence level
2. **Make prediction:** Expected outcome (call publication, budget, timeline)
3. **Track reality:** What actually happened
4. **Calculate accuracy:** Predicted vs. actual (days difference)
5. **Update model:** Refine thresholds based on performance

**Target Metrics:**
- Average lead time: 45-60 days before general awareness
- Prediction accuracy: >75%
- False positive rate: <15%
- Missed opportunities: <5%

---

## Phase Progression

**Phase 1 (Current):** Manual monitoring, validate hypothesis (Week 1)  
**Phase 2:** Semi-automated with Trinity skill (Week 2-3)  
**Phase 3:** Pattern Engine integration (Week 3-4)  
**Phase 4:** Full EUFM integration (Week 4-5)  
**Phase 5:** Automated on Balaur (Week 5-6)

**Decision Gate:** End of Week 1 - if hypothesis validated, proceed to Phase 2 automation.

## Resources

**Daily Time Investment:** 30-45 minutes
- 15 min: Check Comitology + Commission sources
- 20 min: Run Perplexity queries
- 10 min: Log findings

**Tools Needed:**
- RSS reader (for Comitology Register)
- Perplexity access (for daily queries)
- This project folder (for documentation)

---

## Success Definition

**Phase 1 succeeds if:**
1. We detect Cluster 4 draft before it's widely known
2. We validate 4-month lead time pattern
3. We identify 3+ actionable signals
4. Captain approves Phase 2 automation investment

**Long-term success:**
- 45-60 day average lead time on all relevant opportunities
- 2x improvement in application success rate due to better preparation
- €400K+ incremental value per major application
- 40x ROI on Pulse Catcher operational costs

---

## Notes

**Constitutional Alignment:** Early detection is ethical because:
- We help EU deploy funds to best applicants
- More prep time = higher quality applications
- Better applications = better EU policy outcomes
- Transparent methodology, no gaming

**Learning Principle:** Each detection cycle improves the model. By month 6, expect 85%+ accuracy.

---

**Status:** Active monitoring started November 3, 2025  
**Next Review:** November 10, 2025 (end of Phase 1)  
**Next Milestone:** Detect Cluster 4 draft publication
