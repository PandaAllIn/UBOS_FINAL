## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA (Week 1)

You'll know Phase 1 is working if:

- [ ] **You detect Cluster 4 draft before it's widely known** (the BIG WIN!)
- [ ] You complete 7/7 daily scans (establish habit)
- [ ] You identify 3+ new signals worth tracking
- [ ] You understand the workflow well enough to automate

**Decision Point:** November 10, 2025
- If hypothesis validated → Green-light Phase 2 (automation)
- If not working → Refine approach

---

## 📊 WHAT YOU'RE VALIDATING

### Hypothesis from Perplexity Research

**Claim:** Draft work programmes on Comitology Register provide 4-month lead time

**Test Case (Already Validated):**
- Cluster 1 (Health) draft: October 1, 2025
- Final call opening: February 10, 2026
- Lead time: **132 days** ✅ CONFIRMED

**Your Test:**
- Detect Cluster 4 draft in November 2025
- Predict call opening in March-April 2026
- Validate when it actually publishes

### What This Means Strategically

**If validated:**
- 4 extra months to prepare vs. competitors
- Time for strategic consortium building
- 2-3x higher success rate expected
- €400K+ incremental value per major application

**If not validated:**
- Still learned valuable monitoring practices
- Can refine detection methods
- No harm done (manual POC, minimal investment)

## 🔮 THE 6 SIGNALS YOU'RE TRACKING

All are now in `/EUFM/00_SYSTEM/TIMELINE_MATRIX.md`:

### IMMEDIATE Priority
1. **Cluster 4 Draft Watch** - Expected November 2025 (CRITICAL!)

### SHORT-TERM Priority
2. **Horizon Health Feb 10** - Validated signal (control test)
3. **25% Admin Burden Reduction** - Process monitoring

### MEDIUM-TERM Priority
4. **Cluster 4 Calls** - March-April 2026 predicted
5. **Cloud & AI Development Act** - Q2 2026 predicted
6. **EDIH Reinforced AI** - Rolling 2026 opportunities

### LONG-TERM Priority
7. **Quantum Act** - Q3-Q4 2026 predicted

## 📝 WHERE TO LOG FINDINGS

### Daily Scans
**Location:** `daily_scans/YYYY-MM-DD_scan.md`
**Content:** Summary of all checks, Perplexity results, quick observations
**Frequency:** Every day

### Detected Signals
**Location:** `signals_detected/signal_YYYY-MM-DD_[name].md`
**Content:** Full analysis when you find something significant
**Frequency:** When HIGH or CRITICAL signal detected
**Template:** See `manual_check_list.md` for signal file template

### Validation Updates
**Location:** `validation_log.md`
**Content:** Track predictions vs. reality
**Frequency:** Weekly (or when prediction validates/fails)

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE

### IF YOU DETECT CLUSTER 4 DRAFT

**STOP EVERYTHING AND:**

1. ✅ **Verify:** Is it really on official Comitology Register?
2. ✅ **Document:** Create signal file immediately
3. ✅ **Calculate:** Today's date + 132 days = predicted call opening
4. ✅ **Alert:** Update TIMELINE_MATRIX with CRITICAL flag
5. ✅ **Act:** Begin GeoDataCenter consortium building
6. ✅ **Celebrate:** You just gained 4-month competitive advantage! 🎉

**Why this matters:**
- GeoDataCenter = €299M project
- Needs consortium of 10+ partners
- 4 months to build vs. 0 months = success vs. failure
- This ONE detection validates entire Pulse Catcher system

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Make It a Habit
- Same time every day (06:00 UTC)
- Same routine (checklist in order)
- Same location (your morning coffee spot?)
- 30 minutes, no exceptions

### Stay Curious
- Don't just check boxes - read headlines
- Notice patterns - what topics repeat?
- Trust your gut - if something feels significant, log it
- Ask "why now?" - timing tells you about priorities

### Log Everything
- Even negative results (nothing found = data)
- Note your observations (gut feelings matter)
- Track time spent (are we getting faster?)
- Question assumptions (is this really valuable?)

## 📈 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### Week 1 (November 4-10): Manual POC
- You do everything by hand
- Validate the hypothesis
- Learn what works, what doesn't
- Build intuition for signal quality

### Week 2-3 (If Successful): Semi-Automation
- We build Trinity skill `funding-pulse-scout`
- RSS monitoring automated (hourly)
- Perplexity queries automated (daily)
- You review summaries instead of doing scans
- Time drops from 30 min/day → 10 min/day

### Week 4-6 (If Still Working): Full Automation
- Deploy on The Balaur
- Pattern Engine integration
- Automatic TIMELINE_MATRIX updates
- You only see HIGH/CRITICAL alerts
- Time drops to 2 min/day (just review alerts)

**But first:** Prove it works manually.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if I miss a day?**
A: No problem! Catch up the next day. RSS feeds keep history. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

**Q: What if I find nothing for a week?**
A: That's data too! Log "no significant signals" in validation log. Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence.

**Q: What if Cluster 4 draft doesn't appear in November?**
A: Adjust prediction (maybe December?). Track why prediction failed. Refine model. Science!

**Q: How do I know if a signal is significant?**
A: Use criteria in `manual_check_list.md`. When in doubt, log it. Better false positive than missed opportunity.

**Q: This feels like a lot of work for uncertain return?**
A: Phase 1 is validation. If it works, we automate (Phase 2+). If not, we stop. Only €10-20 hours invested total.
