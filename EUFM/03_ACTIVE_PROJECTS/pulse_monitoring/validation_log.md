# Pulse Catcher Validation Log

**Purpose:** Track predictions vs. reality to measure and improve detection accuracy  
**Started:** November 3, 2025  
**Methodology:** Scientific validation of early detection hypothesis

---

## Validation Methodology

### How We Measure Success

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Lead Time:** Days between our detection and general public awareness
2. **Accuracy:** Predicted outcome vs. actual outcome match rate
3. **False Positive Rate:** Signals that didn't materialize / Total signals
4. **False Negative Rate:** Opportunities we missed / Total relevant opportunities

**Target Performance (End of Phase 1):**
- Average Lead Time: 45-60 days
- Prediction Accuracy: >75%
- False Positive Rate: <15%
- False Negative Rate: <5%

---

## Baseline Validation (Historical Test)

### Test Case 1: Horizon Europe Cluster 1 (Health)

**Source:** Perplexity Research (validated October 2025 events)

**Prediction (Hypothetical):**
- If we had detected draft on October 1, 2025
- We would predict call opening ~4 months later

**Actual Events:**
- Draft published: October 1, 2025 (Comitology Register)
- Final call published: February 10, 2026
- Lead time: **132 days (4 months 9 days)** ✅

**Accuracy:** 100% (4-month hypothesis validated)

**Analysis:**
- Pattern confirmed: Draft work programmes provide 4-month lead time
- Source reliability: 100% (official Comitology Register)
- Replicable: If Cluster 4 draft appears, expect similar lag

## Active Predictions (November 2025)

### Prediction #1: Cluster 4 Draft Detection 🔥

**Prediction Made:** November 3, 2025  
**Predicted By:** Claude (based on Perplexity pattern analysis)  
**Confidence:** 85%

**Hypothesis:**
- Cluster 4 (Digital, Industry, Space) draft will appear in Comitology Register in November 2025

- Status: WATCHING
- Found: Not yet / DETECTED on [date]

**If Correct:**
- Lead time advantage: ~120-135 days before final call
- Action: Begin GeoDataCenter consortium immediately
- Action: Position for Digital Europe AI Factories alignment

**If Incorrect:**
- Refine model: Cluster release timing not sequential?

**Validation Date:** June 30, 2026 (mid-year assessment)

**Tracking:**
- Monitor: Application guide updates
- Count: Pages in application forms (should decrease)
- Measure: Time to complete applications
- Observe: Success rate changes

**If Correct:**
- Opportunity: Easier applications = scale up submission volume
- Strategy: Launch grant-as-service when applications simplest

## Accuracy Calculations

### Overall System Accuracy (Cumulative)

```
Prediction Accuracy = (Correct Predictions / Total Validated Predictions) × 100

Target: >75%
```

### Lead Time Average

```
Average Lead Time = Sum of all lead times / Number of early detections

Target: 45-60 days
```

### False Positive Rate

```
FPR = (Signals that didn't materialize / Total signals flagged as HIGH/CRITICAL) × 100

Target: <15%
```

### False Negative Rate

```
FNR = (Relevant opportunities missed / Total relevant opportunities) × 100

Target: <5%
```

**Note:** False negatives are hardest to measure (requires knowing what we didn't know). Use CORDIS/portal data retrospectively.
