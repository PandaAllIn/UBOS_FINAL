## Next Actions

**IMMEDIATE:**
1. Read full programme intel: `../../01_INTELLIGENCE/programs/pnrr_romania.md`
2. Review methodology: `../../00_SYSTEM/METHODOLOGY.md`
3. Decide: Proceed or wait?
4. If proceed: Create project folders, begin Phase 1 (Discovery)

**BLOCKING:**
- Captain decision on timing
- Innovation Romania EoI (Nov 15) takes priority if both pursued

## Notes

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- **Lease:** Atlas Leasing (€400-600/month, 36-48 months) - ongoing cost
- **Rent:** IRENT (€500-1,000/week) - good for demo, expensive long-term
- **Grant (PNRR):** €18K free money but 10-month timeline - BEST LONG-TERM

**Recommendation:** Rent for immediate Málaga demo, apply for PNRR grant simultaneously for permanent hardware.
