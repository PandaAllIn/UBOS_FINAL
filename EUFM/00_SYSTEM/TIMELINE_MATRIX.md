## Timeline Workflow

### Weekly Review (Every Monday)

1. **Update deadlines** - Check all portals for changes
2. **Move opportunities** - Shift between categories as time passes
3. **Assess status** - Are we on track? Falling behind?
4. **Reallocate resources** - Adjust effort based on urgency
5. **Flag risks** - What's at risk of missing deadline?

### Monthly Strategic Review

1. **Portfolio balance** - Do we have right mix of timelines?
2. **Success probability** - Are we pursuing winnable opportunities?
3. **Resource allocation** - Is effort matching opportunity value?
4. **Learning capture** - What did completed applications teach us?

## Risk Flags

🔴 **CRITICAL:** Deadline in <7 days, not submission-ready  
🟡 **WARNING:** Deadline in <14 days, missing key components  
🟢 **ON TRACK:** Progressing as planned  
⚪ **PAUSED:** Deliberately delayed for strategic reasons  
⚫ **CANCELLED:** Decided not to pursue

## Integration with Other Systems

**Scoring:** All opportunities should have score from `SCORING_FRAMEWORK.md`

**Methodology:** Status progression follows phases in `METHODOLOGY.md`

**Oracle Coordination:** Owners can be humans or oracles (documented in `ORACLE_COORDINATION.md`)

**Project Tracking:** Each opportunity has folder in `03_ACTIVE_PROJECTS/`

## Pulse Catcher Signals Legend

**🔮 = Early Detection Signal** (detected via Pulse Monitoring before public awareness)

**Signal Types:**
- **CRITICAL WATCH:** Tracking for imminent detection (e.g., draft work programme expected)
- **VALIDATED SIGNAL:** Confirmed official signal with verified lead time
- **PULSE PREDICTION:** Predictive signal based on policy analysis (confidence varies)
- **MONITORING:** Process or trend signal (not specific opportunity)

**Confidence Levels:**
- **HIGH (85-100%):** Official draft/announcement detected, timing nearly certain
- **MEDIUM (70-84%):** Strong policy signals, timing probable
- **LOW (60-69%):** Emerging indicators, timing uncertain

**Integration:**
- All pulse signals tracked in `/03_ACTIVE_PROJECTS/pulse_monitoring/`
- Validation log tracks prediction accuracy
- Successful predictions trigger automatic project folder creation
- Pattern Engine analyzes signal quality over time

**Strategic Value:**
- Average lead time target: 45-60 days before general awareness
- Validated lead time: 132 days (Horizon Health Cluster 1)
- Expected ROI: 2-3x higher success rate due to better preparation

---

## Version History

**v1.1 (November 2025):** Added Pulse Catcher integration with 6 early-detected signals.

**v1.0 (November 2025):** Initial timeline matrix with current opportunities.
