# EU Funding Opportunity Scoring Framework

**Document ID:** EUFM-SCORE-V1.0  
**Purpose:** Objective evaluation system for prioritizing funding opportunities

---

## Overview

With €50+ billion in EU funding available annually across hundreds of programs, the challenge isn't finding opportunities - it's choosing which ones to pursue. This framework provides an objective scoring system to prioritize efforts where you have highest probability of success and impact.

**Philosophy:** Focus beats spray-and-pray. Better to win 3 out of 5 targeted applications than lose 20 out of 20 rushed attempts.

---

## Composite Scoring Formula

```
TOTAL SCORE = (Budget × 0.3) + (Fit × 0.3) + (Probability × 0.25) + (Impact × 0.15)

Maximum possible score: 5.0
Target threshold: ≥2.8 (28 when scaled to 0-50)
```

### Why These Weights?

**Budget (30%):** Larger opportunities justify more effort. €1M grant worth 10x effort of €100K grant.

**Fit (30%):** Perfect alignment means faster application, higher success rate, better execution.

**Probability (25%):** No point chasing impossible dreams. Must be realistic about chances.

**Impact (15%):** Strategic importance matters, but shouldn't override practical considerations.

---

## Dimension 1: Budget Scale (30% weight)

**Score 1:** <€50,000
- Small grant, limited impact
- Good for testing system
- Low effort/reward ratio

**Score 2:** €50,000 - €200,000
- Meaningful funding
- Justifies moderate effort
- Good for early wins

**Score 3:** €200,000 - €500,000
- Substantial project
- Worth significant preparation
- Game-changing for SMEs

**Score 4:** €500,000 - €5,000,000
- Major funding
- Requires consortium typically
- Can fund significant infrastructure

**Score 5:** >€5,000,000
- Mega-project
- Transforms organization
- Worth months of preparation

**Example:**
- €20K DGX hardware grant = Score 1
- €60M Digital Europe AI Factory = Score 5
- €299M GeoDataCenter (combined) = Score 5

---

## Dimension 2: Project-Program Fit (30% weight)

**Score 1:** Poor match
- Major gaps between project and program goals
- Would need significant scope changes
- Evaluators would question relevance

**Score 2:** Partial match
- Some alignment but missing key elements
- Would need to emphasize certain aspects
- Competitive disadvantage

**Score 3:** Good match
- Clear alignment with program objectives
- Can address all evaluation criteria
- Competitive but not exceptional

**Score 4:** Strong match
- Excellent alignment
- Hits multiple program priorities
- Natural competitive advantage

**Score 5:** Perfect match
- Could have been written for this program
- Addresses all priorities optimally
- Evaluators will immediately see fit

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Does your project directly address stated program objectives?
- Do you meet preferred TRL (Technology Readiness Level)?
- Are you in priority geography/sector?
- Do you have preferred partnership structure?
- Can you deliver all required outcomes?

**Example:**
- UBOS constitutional AI governance for EU Digital Sovereignty = Score 5 (perfect political alignment)
- UBOS for commercial AI services = Score 3 (good but generic)

---

## Dimension 3: Success Probability (25% weight)

**Score 1:** <20% chance
- Highly competitive
- Weak competitive position
- Missing key requirements
- First-time applicant disadvantage

**Score 2:** 20-40% chance
- Competitive
- Meet minimum requirements
- Some advantages, some gaps
- Need everything to go right

**Score 3:** 40-60% chance
- Moderate competition
- Strong application possible
- Good track record or partnerships
- Realistic shot with effort

**Score 4:** 60-80% chance
- Favorable position
- Strong competitive advantages
- Proven track record
- Well-positioned

**Score 5:** >80% chance
- Exceptional position
- Perfect eligibility
- Strong precedent or relationships
- Almost guaranteed with decent application

**Factors to Consider:**
- Typical program success rate (some programs fund 5%, others 40%)
- Your eligibility strength (do you barely qualify or exceed requirements?)
- Competition level (how many applicants expected?)
- Your track record (first-timer or proven winner?)
- Partnership strength (top-tier collaborators or struggling to find?)

**Example:**
- Innovation Romania (106M pool, early-stage focused, Romanian advantage) = Score 4
- ERC Advanced Grant (5% success rate, need exceptional research record) = Score 1
- PNRR Digitalization (regional priority, precedent cases, clear eligibility) = Score 4.5

---

## Dimension 4: Strategic Impact (15% weight)

**Score 1:** Nice to have
- Non-critical
- Doesn't affect core mission
- Could easily do without

**Score 2:** Useful
- Would help but not essential
- Alternative paths exist
- Opportunistic

**Score 3:** Important
- Supports strategic goals
- Accelerates roadmap
- Valuable but not blocking

**Score 4:** Very important
- Key enabler
- Unblocks critical path
- Major advancement

**Score 5:** Mission-critical
- Cannot proceed without
- Foundational to strategy
- Existential importance

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Does this enable other opportunities?
- Does this create competitive moat?
- Does this advance constitutional mission?
- Does this unlock follow-on funding?
- What happens if we DON'T get this?

**Example:**
- €20K DGX hardware = Score 5 (blocks Málaga demo, enables grant-as-service business, unlocks GeoDataCenter pathway)
- €50K marketing budget = Score 2 (nice to have, can grow organically)

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: PNRR Digitalization Grant (DGX Hardware)

**Budget:** €20K (€18K grant) = **Score 1**
**Fit:** Perfect match - SME digitalization, hardware eligible, meets all criteria = **Score 5**
**Probability:** Strong - 70% success rate for eligible applicants, clear precedent = **Score 4**
**Impact:** Mission-critical - enables immediate revenue, demo capability, cascade effect = **Score 5**

**Total Score:**
```
(1 × 0.3) + (5 × 0.3) + (4 × 0.25) + (5 × 0.15)
= 0.3 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 0.75
= 3.55
```

**Decision:** PURSUE IMMEDIATELY ✅ (score >2.8, impact critical)

---

### Example 2: Digital Europe AI Factories

**Budget:** €60M available = **Score 5**
**Fit:** Excellent - AI infrastructure, sovereignty angle, Romanian advantage = **Score 4.5**
**Probability:** Moderate - competitive but strong positioning = **Score 3**
**Impact:** Very high - enables GeoDataCenter, creates moat = **Score 4.5**

**Total Score:**
```
(5 × 0.3) + (4.5 × 0.3) + (3 × 0.25) + (4.5 × 0.15)
= 1.5 + 1.35 + 0.75 + 0.675
= 4.275
```

**Decision:** PURSUE STRATEGICALLY ✅ (top-tier opportunity, requires consortium)

---

### Example 3: Generic Horizon Europe Research Grant

**Budget:** €2M = **Score 4**
**Fit:** Partial - need to frame UBOS as pure research = **Score 2**
**Probability:** Low - 15% success rate, intense competition = **Score 1**
**Impact:** Moderate - would help but not critical = **Score 3**

**Total Score:**
```
(4 × 0.3) + (2 × 0.3) + (1 × 0.25) + (3 × 0.15)
= 1.2 + 0.6 + 0.25 + 0.45
= 2.5
```

**Decision:** SKIP ❌ (below threshold, poor fit, low probability)

---

### Example 4: GeoDataCenter (Innovation Fund)

**Budget:** €70M (part of €299M total) = **Score 5**
**Fit:** Exceptional - geothermal + AI + sovereignty = **Score 5**
**Probability:** Moderate-high - 40-50% for projects scoring 4.5/5 = **Score 4**
**Impact:** Transformational - builds empire, replicable model = **Score 5**

**Total Score:**
```
(5 × 0.3) + (5 × 0.3) + (4 × 0.25) + (5 × 0.15)
= 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 0.75
= 4.75
```

**Decision:** STRATEGIC PRIORITY ✅✅✅ (nearly perfect score, worth months of effort)

---

## Decision Matrix

| Score Range | Classification | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| ≥4.0 | Top Priority | Pursue immediately, allocate maximum resources |
| 3.5-3.9 | High Priority | Pursue with full effort |
| 2.8-3.4 | Medium Priority | Pursue if resources available |
| 2.0-2.7 | Low Priority | Consider only if strategic fit exceptional |
| <2.0 | Skip | Do not pursue |

---

## Special Considerations

### Early-Stage System Building
If building track record, consider opportunities scoring 2.5-2.8 for learning value, even if marginal ROI.

### Portfolio Approach
Pursue mix of high-probability/low-budget (quick wins) and low-probability/high-budget (lottery tickets).

### Timing Constraints
Urgent deadlines may force pursuit of lower-scoring opportunities if blocking critical path.

### Cascade Effects
Some opportunities unlock others. Factor in second-order effects in Impact score.

### Partnership Synergies
Consortium applications may score higher due to shared effort and complementary strengths.

---

## Using This Framework

### Step 1: Score Each Dimension
Use 0.1 precision (e.g., 3.7, not just 3 or 4) for accuracy.

### Step 2: Calculate Total
Apply weighted formula.

### Step 3: Compare Opportunities
Rank all active considerations.

### Step 4: Apply Decision Matrix
Determine pursue/skip for each.

### Step 5: Allocate Resources
Assign effort proportional to score and urgency.

## Calibration Over Time

**This framework improves with use:**

After each application, review:
- Was score accurate?
- What was actual success rate vs. predicted?
- What factors did we over/underweight?
- Should we adjust weights or criteria?

Update this document based on empirical results.
