## Success Factors

### Must-Haves

✅ **GHG impact >1 Mt CO₂e lifetime** (we have 5.93 Mt)  
✅ **TRL 7-9** (technology ready for deployment)  
✅ **Financial additionality** (wouldn't happen without grant)  
✅ **Solid consortium** (technical + financial + operational)  
✅ **Realistic budget** (market-validated costs)  
✅ **Clear replication pathway** (how others can copy)  

### Common Pitfalls

❌ Technology too early (TRL <7)  
❌ Insufficient GHG impact calculation  
❌ Weak financial model  
❌ No clear market barrier (why does this need public support?)  
❌ Overly ambitious timeline  
❌ Consortium gaps (missing critical capabilities)
