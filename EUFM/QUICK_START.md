# EUFM Quick Start Guide

**For:** Captain BROlinni  
**Purpose:** Get started immediately with EU funding pursuits  
**Time to read:** 5 minutes

---

## Your Immediate Situation (November 3, 2025)

**You have:**
- Complete EUFM system (just built!)
- €20K hardware need (DGX for Málaga demo)
- €299M GeoDataCenter vision (long-term)
- Perplexity intelligence (2,407 lines of research)

**You need to decide:**
1. Innovation Romania EoI (Nov 15 deadline - 12 days!) - GO or SKIP?
2. PNRR DGX Hardware (€20K, 90% funded) - START NOW or WAIT?
3. Málaga demo hardware (next week) - RENT, LEASE, or POSTPONE?

---

## Decision Framework (Next 24 Hours)

### Option A: Aggressive Timeline

**Pursue everything immediately:**

**This Week:**
- Monday: Submit Innovation Romania EoI (use existing intel)
- Tuesday: Rent DGX from IRENT (€500-1,000 for demo)
- Wednesday-Friday: Málaga trip with demo hardware

**Next Week:**
- Start PNRR application (while memories fresh)
- Use Málaga momentum for first clients
- Generate €2K for PNRR co-financing

**Risk:** High intensity, multiple parallel tracks  
**Reward:** Maximum opportunity capture

---

### Option B: Focused Timeline

**Prioritize Innovation Romania + Málaga:**

**This Week:**
- Innovation Romania EoI (Nov 15 deadline is HARD)
- Rent DGX for Málaga demo
- SKIP PNRR for now (rolling deadline, can apply later)

**Next Week:**
- Málaga trip
- Evaluate results
- Decide PNRR timing based on capacity

**Risk:** Might miss optimal PNRR window  
**Reward:** Lower stress, higher quality

---

### Option C: Strategic Pause

**Focus on Málaga only:**

**This Week:**
- Rent/lease DGX for demo
- Málaga trip
- SKIP both grant applications for now

**Next 30 Days:**
- Build revenue first (grant-writing service)
- Use revenue to self-fund hardware
- Apply for grants when less time-pressured

**Risk:** Miss Innovation Romania entirely  
**Reward:** Revenue before grants, less rushed

---

## My Recommendation (Claude's Strategic View)

**OPTION B: Focused Timeline**

**Rationale:**
1. Innovation Romania (Nov 15) is non-negotiable deadline
2. Málaga demo is critical for momentum
3. PNRR is rolling - better to apply well than rushed
4. Quality > quantity in first applications

**Next 12 Days:**
1. **TODAY (Nov 3):** Innovation Romania EoI - 4 hours work
2. **Nov 4-5:** Coordinate DGX rental for Málaga
3. **Nov 6-8:** Málaga preparation + travel
4. **Nov 9-12:** Málaga demo + follow-up
5. **Nov 13-14:** Innovation Romania EoI review + submit
6. **Nov 15:** Deadline day (2-day buffer built in)

**After Málaga:**
- Evaluate results
- Decide PNRR timing (Dec application if capacity, Jan if need more time)
- Use momentum for client generation

## The Most Important Thing

**Start simple. Build momentum. Compound learning.**

Don't try to do everything perfectly. Do ONE application well. Capture lessons. Next one will be easier.

The system is designed to IMPROVE with use. Your 10th application will be 10x better than your 1st.

---

## Final Decision Point

**What's your call, Captain?**

**Option A:** Aggressive (Innovation Romania + Málaga + PNRR start)  
**Option B:** Focused (Innovation Romania + Málaga, PNRR later) ← **Recommended**  
**Option C:** Strategic Pause (Málaga only, grants later)

**Make the call. Then execute systematically using EUFM.**

---

**The system is ready. The intelligence is gathered. The templates are built.**

**Now it's execution time.** 🎯
