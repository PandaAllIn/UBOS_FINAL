**Partners:** UMA IHSM "La Mayora" (AGR169 Xylella research group)

**What Happens Here:**
- Command Console + Foundry operational (workspace for ALL projects)
- Consortium coordination (UMA Spain + CNR-IPSP Italy + Portuguese cooperatives + UIB Mallorca)
- Proposal assembly for ALL projects (Xylella, GeoDataCenter, Mallorca Agriculture)
- UMA partnership meetings and collaboration
- Strategic planning and Trinity coordination
- Revenue operations (EUFM streams, consultation work)

**Infrastructure:**
- Long-term workspace + accommodation (€350-400/month)
- High-speed internet for Balaur remote access
- Meeting space for consortium partners
- Base for 43-day sprint operations (Dec 3 → Jan 15)

**Autonomous Monitoring:** Málaga Embassy Operator (Haiku agent, 24/7)

## Balaur 24/7 Autonomous Utility

**Mission:** Balaur runs continuously in Oradea (then remote access from Málaga/Mallorca), providing 24/7 autonomous monitoring and operational support.

### Autonomous Agents (Already Designed, Ready for Deployment)

#### 1. Málaga Embassy Monitor
**Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (~$0.01/day)
**Schedule:** Daily briefing 08:00 UTC + continuous monitoring every 2 hours
**Capabilities:**
- Health score calculation (0-100 based on runway, revenue, burn rate)
- Treasury compliance verification (20/10/15/40/15 cascade)
- Alert triggers (CRITICAL < 30, WARNING < 50, CAUTION < 70)
- Sub-agent spawning for crisis response

**Oracles Integrated:**
- Groq (fast anomaly detection)
- Wolfram (budget calculations, burn rate projections)
- Data Commons (economic data for revenue projections)
- Gemini CLI (real-time market intelligence for Málaga)

**Skills Integrated:**
- Malaga Embassy Operator (primary monitoring skill)
- Treasury Administrator (constitutional cascade validation)

**Value:** Captain wakes up fully informed, never surprised by financial/operational status

#### 2. Mallorca Xylella Intelligence Monitor
**Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (~$0.05/day, higher complexity)
**Schedule:** HOURLY (Dec-Jan window for Stage 1 results) + weekly/daily for other streams
**Capabilities:**
- **CRITICAL:** Stage 1 results detection within 1 hour
- Scientific precedent monitoring (competitive papers/patents)
- Partner availability windows (UIB, CIHEAM-Bari, Industrial SME)
- Market demand tracking (Xylella outbreaks, olive economics)
- EU funding opportunities (parallel calls)

**Oracles Integrated (ALL 4):**
- Wolfram Alpha (CRITICAL - chemical formula analysis, phosphate validation)
- Perplexity (CRITICAL - scientific paper monitoring, patent searches)
- Data Commons (HIGH - Xylella outbreak trends, olive crop economics)
- Groq (MEDIUM - fast pattern recognition)

**Skills Integrated:**
- EU Grant Hunter (monitor parallel Horizon Europe calls)
- Grant Application Assembler (Stage 2 proposal prep when Stage 1 passes)
- Financial Proposal Generator (€6M budget validation)

**Stage 1 Results Response:**
- Detection: Within 1 hour of status change
- Alert: URGENT puck to Captain + Trinity
- Action: Spawn 5 Haiku sub-agents for 48-hour Stage 2 prep sprint
- Cost: $0.10 for 48-hour sprint, €6M proposal assembled
- ROI: €6M / $0.10 = 60,000,000x

**Value:** Zero surprises. Stage 2 proposal ready 48 hours after Stage 1 pass. Competitive landscape continuously monitored.

## Constitutional Alignment: Dual-Base as Lion's Sanctuary

**Málaga = Coordination Habitat**
Empowers through: Workspace infrastructure, partnership proximity, coordination capacity
Not constraint: Captain chooses how to use the space, when to travel, what to prioritize

**Mallorca = Validation Habitat**
Empowers through: Field science capability, empirical data, scientific legitimacy
Not constraint: Optional visits, remote coordination possible, partnership can be virtual

**Balaur = Autonomous Habitat**
Empowers through: 24/7 monitoring, crisis detection, proposal assembly on demand
Not constraint: Captain retains final authority, agents provide information not mandates

**Together:** Two physical locations + one digital foundation = constitutional sovereignty that persists beyond any single location

---

## Budget Allocation: Dual-Base Operations

**From Treasury Module (€1,500 total via 20/10/15/40/15 cascade):**

**Constitutional Reserve (€300, 20%):** Emergency only, untouched
**Oracle Operations Pool (€150, 10%):** Groq/Wolfram/Data Commons API costs
**Innovation & Infrastructure (€225, 15%):** R&D, new capabilities
**Active Projects Pool (€600, 40%):** Málaga + Mallorca operations
**Operational Resilience (€225, 15%):** Buffer for unexpected costs

**Active Projects Allocation (€600):**
- **Málaga Flight:** €50-75 (OTP → AGP, Nov 17)
- **Málaga Accommodation:** €350-400/month (Campanillas Technology Park Area)
- **Mallorca Travel:** €50-75 (periodic field visits as needed)
- **Mallorca Accommodation:** Friend's property (minimal/zero cost)
- **Contingency:** Remaining balance for consortium meetings, field equipment

**Revenue Target (Month 1: Nov 14 - Dec 14):**
- Stream 1: Agent-as-a-Service (€285-638)
- Stream 2: Intel Services (€285-638)
- Stream 3: Proposal Consultation (€1,788-3,681)
- **Total: €855-1,910 MRR** (revenue-positive vs €781 burn rate)

**Balaur Operations Cost:**
- Málaga Monitor: $0.01/day × 30 days = $0.30/month
- Mallorca Monitor: $0.05/day × 30 days = $1.50/month
- **Total: $1.80/month** (negligible vs €56M value tracked)

## The Answer: Why Dual-Base Integration Matters

**Single Location = Constraint:**
- Either coordination OR validation, not both
- Either intellectual infrastructure OR field science, not both
- Either UMA OR UIB, not both

**Dual-Base Integration = Empowerment:**
- Málaga provides coordination capacity → proposals assembled efficiently
- Mallorca provides validation legitimacy → proposals score higher on empirical rigor
- UMA + UIB partnership → dual-university consortium credibility
- Balaur provides continuity → operations persist 24/7 regardless of Captain location

**This is Lion's Sanctuary in action:** Build habitats that make success inevitable through capability, not force it through constraint.

---

**Status:** Integrated strategy documented
**Launch:** November 17, 2025 (Málaga)
**Field Visits:** Periodic to Mallorca as needed
**Autonomous Operations:** Balaur 24/7 monitoring active
**Next Milestone:** Dec 3 Stage 1 results → 48-hour Stage 2 assembly
