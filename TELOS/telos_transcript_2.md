Yeah. Yeah. Things are um going pretty well. Uh just the past few weeks I
haven't recorded a lot cuz you know we went on a road trip to um kind of deal with our dog putting our dog down and
then we got back and my dad's having major brain surgery. It's just you kind of a lot to to carry and you don't
realize the strain on you and your family until after you after you've gone through it and you're like, "Oh my gosh,
that was a lot." But uh getting back to like the the office the studio sitting down just kind of being by myself away
from some away from kids and stuff it's it's nice getting back to normaly and routine
but yeah things are good things are good that's awesome yeah the thing I like that you're doing the most is like
you're taking the different tech stuff and then you're figuring out how to build it into
a home workflow right with like the open source models and
So you're turning it into like a life workflow that works for you at the house and like okay can my employees use this?
Can my team can my family use this or whatever. And that's with like a pipeline of tech
which maybe maybe this is part is like open source maybe this part is not open source or whatever. It's like what can
we do locally that we don't need to depend on all these different services. Yeah. And I I'm such a big fan of local
because it's it's powerful and so many things go to the cloud like Alexa now. I
mean like I was already trying to kick her to the curb, but now they're officially saying you don't have any option to prevent any of your data going
to the cloud. Like it's just going to happen now. And that's just crazy to me. Um but yeah, I I won't make any content.
It's almost impossible for me to make content that's not something I can implement myself for my employees or my
family. that's that's not going to be fun and usable and that I will use every day. I just can't do it, right? Yeah. And then plus, you don't
want your pipeline to break because some third party made some crazy change, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's that is so annoying.
Um see, I like having ultimate control. Um I was just trying to figure out how to host my own financial management
software. I don't know what you use, but I've been using like I used Mint before it tanked and I then I switched to Quick
and Simplify, but it wasn't simplify. It was stupid. I hated it. there's got to be an open source
solution, right? And there was and they're kind of weird. So, I don't know, but it's just it's fun to explore that
stuff. Interesting. So, I would have thought you would do something like um because
this is what I was thinking for myself is just host the data. Um if you host
the data in some like a parquet file or some sort of schema, I would just be
running AI against the data. So, that's that's my ultimate goal. So, I needed something that could um just
house the data like what you're describing. So, there source solutions that would pull in your your stuff,
structure it, allow you to um set budgets and and apply tags and categorization, but it has a robust API.
So, then you could just integrate with AI and do all kinds of crazy analyzation after that because I I'm, you know, trying to work with my wife. So, I'm
like here, here's the nice friendly gooey. As long as I have API access, I can go nuts with this. So, that was kind
of like where I was looking for. Um, so I found a few solutions, but yeah, ultimately if it was just like me and
she she didn't need access, I would just do what you're saying. Um, some crazy database, don't need a guey, don't need
a UI, just let AI go nuts. Um, do you use anything like that? No, I'm not. I' I've got an accountant
who's like it's all offloaded to, but at some point I might do this. But you're
right, you still need a UX, right? Uhhuh. If not for yourself, then for you
know uh regular people. Right. Right. Right. And it's and it's good for a sanity check too like you
want to make sure the transactions are coming in not being duplicated. It can handle that that that easy stuff and um
without bogging down a it handles that first step of AI that you might have a dedicated agent to just categorize stuff.
Yeah. So it's kind um getting to your TLO stuff. Uh, this
is great timing for me cuz I the reason we went on that road trip was um my dog
dying, which it's so weird. I'm not really like a diehard dog person. Like
I've always had dogs growing up, but they've always been dogs to me. So like this dog we had, you know, he's was 15
years old and by the end of life he's like not really even a dog anymore. He's just he's just
existing and he's just peeing all over the house and it's like I'm like when is this guy gonna kick the bucket? He's
just annoying. But then when he died, I'm like, why is this hitting me so hard?
This is so weird because that was not my attitude before this. And I think I I I had to sit in it for a
minute and let it just kind of wash over me. But what I figured out is it's what he symbolized.
We got him when we uh first got married. Like we came back from our honeymoon. On our way back, we picked him up because
we always wanted a pug. And um he was just there for every birth, every
birthday, every celebration. He just so he made me like reflect on all those memories and go,
am I where I want to be? Am I doing what I want to do? Am I am I working too much? Am I not in my kids' lives enough?
I I I don't know. So just kind of like waterfall. So the road trip was a chance
to just let's disconnect and allow ourselves to just kind of live. And now
getting back, I'm like, okay, every loose thought I had, every feeling I had, I need to somehow systematize that
so I can make sure I'm always on track or at least I can figure out what the next steps are. So, Tilos, I need your
help. Okay, awesome. Well, so aside from um
what we're going to talk about now, but um so for a few of my friends, I've been doing these TLO sessions where we
basically get together for two hours and we just walk through your stuff and build a full TLOS thing. Um cuz like
yeah, I've got mine here and we're going to talk through it, but what I'm saying is we could do a private session as well
if you want to spin yours up. That'd be cool. And so you're like like a little like a therapist for your friend.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's uh it's funny because you're really just extracting from them, but them hearing
them talk about it and then they see it on the page, they're like, I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing.
It's just it's just the frame the framework really helps. So um so the the
background for this is basically this concept of like human 3.0, know, which
is um I'm just really worried that the current system of jobs and like employment and
uh I don't know. I feel like the the economy itself like it just kind of
doesn't work anymore. And I've been trying to figure out like why since I don't know since like 22 or something. I
I feel like everyone is sensing this like if you probably see the job boards a lot because I know you you think about
jobs as well, right? you're getting influx all the time. What do I need to study? What do I need to learn, right?
What what's going to keep me relevant? So, I feel like there's this massive anxiety and it's been there for quite
some time. And the way I think about it is like
if it's a Saturday and you think about Monday,
do you smile or do you feel dread? Right? And I feel
like if you feel dread thinking about Monday, it's it's a serious problem. And I feel
like too many people feel dread uh for a number of reasons. Like the the last uh
few corporate jobs I've had and like the different consulting that I've done, the
s what people do at work these days is insane. It's it's basically, hey, we
need to get ready for this plan because the goals came out from the company. So, I need you to get all your stuff ready
to make a plan. So, um I need five different meetings for that. You start
getting ready. You've got your work that you're supposed to be doing, but you're doing all this planning to get ready for this thing that just came out from the
higherups, right? Well, that happens. You do all this work for two to three weeks to get ready for that. Then they
change the plan and you've got to completely redo it and it's like a complete nightmare. And um then you've
got the layoffs happening at the same time. You've got all these different stressors. You got politics because some
people are being laid off. And the the whole time there's not like a clear vision from the company.
Um and then when people start getting laid off, you're like, am I next? What what do I need to be doing different
because this obviously isn't working. So, um I have felt that pretty much in like
every job, especially from um like the people around me. And then there's this
book uh I don't know if you ever seen it. It's like bull bull crap uh except for the the stronger version of that
word uh bull crap jobs by David Greyber.
Really really interesting because it talks about like how many of the jobs that we actually do are just kind of like hollow.
Um so in 22 I went independent with uh my
own business and right after that chat GPT came out and then uh GPD4 came out a
few months later after that and I started realizing how much AI was going
to actually make this problem worse because I was already really worried about it then but after AI I'm like okay
this is becoming a serious problem. So it's like this feeling of dread
combined with the fact that like all these job or a lot of jobs many jobs aren't just aren't fulfilling.
And what that brought me to is like this revelation that's really disturbing to
me which is I think the underlying problem is that the ideal number of employees
for most companies is actually zero. like these big corporations
because the reason they have all this headcount is because the founder or
creator of that company wanted to make a thing and they weren't
able to do all the work. Mhm. But if they have all these agents that can actually do the work, it it's not
that they're firing people, it's that they don't need those people. Mhm. So if they were to do the business
over again in say 2027, they would have 100 people instead of 10,000 people or or something, whatever
that date is, right? It might not be 27, might be after that. But it's it's
almost like we've been kind of lied to about the fact that there will always be
jobs, right? There will always be jobs.
Um because it's somebody's job to give us a job,
right? I mean, I felt like I was taught that all through school. You just you just know there's going to
be work because that's just how the world works. And I don't think there's ever been a
questioning of the assumption of like why why do these jobs exist? It's actually because
the person who came up with the idea is not able to do the work. That is scary.
the the moment it becomes possible for them to do the work without you that becomes scary.
So all that to say it it raised in my mind
okay well if we don't have these guaranteed jobs what are we actually going to do to have meaning for
ourselves and in the in the shorter term because this is not going to happen overnight.
This is going to happen over multiple years. Um, in the shorter term, how do you
differentiate yourself versus someone else? If both of you are just kind of executing tasks and doing work,
h how can you separate yourself from someone else? And and I think it comes down to knowing yourself really well.
You have to know what you are about. And um one one thing that I think is really
fascinating about this is um the way to know this is to just ask
somebody what they're about. Uh so I I use this uh this example of
like a visiting alien with a clipboard. So they just show up, they're very friendly, and they have a clipboard and
a pencil or whatever, and they're just like, "Yeah, I just been all over the universe. I just went to this other
galaxy. I'm done with that one. I'm starting with you. So, what are you about? What are you doing?
And most people will just respond with a blank stare at that. They'll just be
like, "What what do you mean?" Like, I I have a job at uh, you know, Nvidia and
I I update the spreadsheet and I do this thing and um, you know, when the boss says I do this other this other task, I
go and do that instead. And like I go home and I watch some shows and that's what do you mean? It's like what are you
about? That that's your job. What are you about? Right? What makes what are your opinions of the world? What do you
think should be different? And I don't think people are trained to think that way. I I think
um unfortunately somehow and I grew up in the San Francisco Bay area so I I
count myself lucky in this way because we were all told that we were special or something. uh or a lot more than other
people. But I feel like too much of education is like listen uh little Bobby or Sue or
whatever. Um there are some special people in the world. You're probably not one of them,
right? There are special people. You will know the special people because they will be on TV.
They will be giving presentations at uh conferences. Um they will be writing books. This is
not something um 99% of people can do.
So, you're probably not one of those people. And nobody ever says that sentence, but
that is the message that everyone is getting. So, nobody is like really trained to believe that they have
anything unique to offer. And I'm saying that this is extremely dangerous
when we're hit with AI because if you're not one of those people who believes that about yourself, then it could take
you out faster. So that is why I'm basically moving towards
this concept of self-capture which um I I'm doing through this concept called uh
tilos. I understand that we're all told that not everyone is special, but also
not everyone can be special because then special loses meaning. The people who do speak at conferences
are I I feel like are the people who naturally rise to the top and not everyone should speak because then
everyone would be talking. Um so I I kind of I I I don't see how
everyone can be in a way special. Interesting. Very interesting. So I I
think I disagree. Um I just think there would be more conferences and we would be more hyper specialized.
So there wouldn't be 10 conferences and there's only 50 slots at each conference
which means only the top whatever get in. I would say
it would be more like everyone is streaming, everyone is speaking, everyone has like a small conference.
Um, and because we grow up different, we study
different things, we think about different things, we just have different perspectives on life. So I would say
ideally not everyone but almost everyone should be thinking should be coming up with
their own unique ideas and should be able to present on something at some
kind of conference. I just think it'd be like a whole bunch of micro conferences because I agree you can't have a conference with like 900 tracks and it's
nine months long nobody will go right. It's it's not a real thing. But but I I
would say that we would just change what conferences look like. It would just be more often and smaller, more granular.
Okay, that's interesting. Um my one rebuttal to that would be I think we we
already see that with social media where we got a bunch of people talking, but I
choose to follow the people that I deem important and and and I deem as um
having a better voice and not follow everyone. And I feel like that would end up happening either way. The bigger
conference would still happen because people want to hear from the biggest voices that they seem that they deem valuable and the smaller conferences
would disappear. Yeah. So, so it's really interesting
we're talking about this because um do you do you follow any YouTube channels that are smaller? Because those are th
those are what I'm saying is those are conferences. So there's people with like 5,000 subscribers. Like I just found
this guy who's um like a pianist and he's like watching metal videos because I love metal. And so it's just this
really deep musician watching stuff that I like and giving his interpretation. So
it turns out someone else's perspective on something I already enjoy that is a a
mini conference, a YouTube channel or whatever. And I actually follow dozens
of people like that who I I love their it's not the biggest channel. It's not the best produced. They don't have the
biggest audience, but some combination of the unique thing that they're offering or the unique perspective that
they have makes it useful to a small number of people. Maybe that's 10,000 people.
Maybe it's a hundred people. But I don't think that's a problem. Well, so here
here's the thing that's going to solve it. Um, and this is a little bit of a tangent, but not really. Your and my
AIS, which which I call digital assistants, they will be crawling every
single one of those channels. Like, forget conference, like let's just call it a channel or a um yeah, YouTube
channel or whatever. It it knows our brains, it knows us, it knows what we like, knows everything
about us. It's crawling all that stuff and finding that content and bringing it to us. So, somebody who just popped up
with a new channel with a hundred followers might be putting out better content that you really really enjoy
than somebody who you follow who has 100,000 followers. Yeah, I guess we we kind of already see
that in a way except it's not an AI that's tailored to us. It's an algorithm that YouTube operates. So, that's how I
do find smaller creators. I imagine that's how you found that pianist that it's a small creator that has no business being in front of you except
for the fact that the algorithm thought, "Huh, you like this, this, and this. Here's a guy who's small. You might like his stuff." So, I do find people like
that. Um, and I think it's it is their uniqueness and their very uh specialized
niche that makes me attracted to them. But also, I think they're not the only one in that niche. And it's they are
where they are. even if it's like 5,000 uh subscribers, that might be the the cream of the crop. Like they are the
best in that niche. Yeah. So, I guess my thing is I think we we already kind of see with what YouTube
and social media has done a bunch of little experts being made. Um and and we have hyper specialized
conferences, so to say. All I think the other side of this is that I don't think I don't think a lot
of people would do any of that. I think a lot of people are very happy with being in the background, very happy with
not with not having a voice at all. Um, and I agree with that. I and I never thought that way until I
owned a business. And I thought everyone was like me. I'm like, if everyone had the opportunity to have their mind shifted, they would of course want to be
an entrepreneur and start their own YouTube channel. I was telling everyone, start a YouTube channel. But I noticed my employees, some of them just loved
having a boundary set for them, a nice sandbox, and saying, "Here, you do this one thing." And they thrived. They
didn't want to do anything else. So, I just I think that I agree that for like people like you
and me, we need what you're talking about because we're just going to drown. But for a lot of people, they just love
being in the background and doing the the the standard stuff. So, what's the future for them?
I I think there's still value in that. First of all, I I think there are a lot
of I'm calling this nurturing. So, I feel like it's nurturing. Um there there's a whole class of of people who
are just they they don't want to be the person, they want to help the person be the person,
right? And so that could be a teacher, a tutor, parent, it could be lots of lots
of different types of u people. But there is actually a merging of this as well where it's like yes, I'm a
nurturer. My favorite thing is to lift other people, but I also want to talk about a methodology for doing that. So
then they become a primary even though they're talking about how to lift other people who are primaries. So I I I think
it's possible to merge. Um but to your point, not everyone has to
be that or wants to be that. And I I think there's still room for that. I I think um we're going to have to find a
way in in the economy to still reward that that kind of contribution.
Yeah, that that's the biggest thing which I know will probably be like we can't predict that, but it's like how do how are people going to pay for things?
How why would you make anything if there's no one with jobs to pay for it? And there's just like a really weird economic problem that'll have to be
solved with AI because y it's gonna AI is gonna ruin the companies that are using it because they
have no one to sell to anymore. Um but also getting back to the question you'll ask people that whole alien and
the clipboard situation. I think for people like you and me and for a a lot of people in this space they will go oh
I don't know. I should have an answer for that. I think also there's a lot of people who will go, "Huh, I don't know.
Also, I don't care. Like, I'm just living my life and that's it." And maybe that's trained and and that's just how
they were brought up. Or maybe that's just how people some people like to live. They just want to exist. And I
know people like that. They're just happy with what's been given to them and they have no designs to figure out anything else.
I 100% agree with you and I know many people like that. I'm personally
concerned that they're going to get steamrolled because people who are like look I just
do my tasks and when I'm done with my tasks I leave problem is I can capture those tasks in AI and explain them to AI
and AI is going to go build a model that does those tasks and maybe that requires
a robot which is a little bit further along but it's just so much easier to replace
than this other thing that I'm talking about. So when I hear someone say that, it's like, look, I just like to do so
and so. It's like, I don't want to think too much about it. It's like, well, someone's going to be thinking a lot
about how to replace you. So that's why I'm like, I wouldn't be trying to force
this mind shift if I thought that people who weren't doing the mind shift were just going to be okay.
I I don't I don't I'm worried they're not going to be okay. Okay, gotcha. And by the way, like I'm
just being devil's advocate with a lot of I do agree with what you're saying, but also I'm like
if I and I'm thinking about my my family, my friends, my my my siblings communicate this vision. They'd be like,
"Shut up. Go back to your EI stuff. Leave me alone." They don't get it. Yep. Yep. No, I Same here. Same here.
family, friends, close friends, people I've known for decades, and it's still they're just like, "Yeah, I don't I
don't see the threat. I don't care if it's there. Like, I'm never going to be that person."
I don't know. Yeah, I'm I'm a little concerned uh about how hard it's going to be to move the needle on this.
Well, so hopefully we can, and this is what I'm hoping is I can learn from you and be able to distill this enough to
where it's it becomes very hyper practical. the next steps. It's like because I feel
like we can get there to where we're like, okay, let's just do a file and let's walk through an example and let's let's figure out what you're about. And
I think that could be very helpful. But anyways, let's let's continue this so I can know what you're talking about. Yeah, perfect.
And I was I was talking with uh Jason. He was like, "Yeah, Dan, he's always been right about all this stuff. He's
been talking about this stuff for like 15 years." Yeah. You're kind of like the prophet, the
modern day prophet for us. It's hilarious. All right. You see a browser? I do.
Okay, cool. So, this is um the GitHub project. It's it's uh it's really just
two files. It's a description of the project and it's two files and essentially an open- source framework
for creating deep context about things that matters that matter to humans, right? So,
you can do this on a it's kind of scalable. Um mostly when I think of Tilos I think of for an individual but
um I actually have business stuff that I do uh with products and stuff. It's using the same basic tilos concept. Uh
so uh my work just like Jason's is like around um
I do a lot of security program stuff right and um attack surface monitoring and management stuff. You can manage any
program using this because it's just like a structure. All right. So this is kind of the structure in a text format
and we're going we're going to talk about it through a text format and also some visuals here. So um
first thing to do is kind of explain because the thing is designed to be used with AI. So the first thing I do is kind
of explain what the concept is um and tell it what the basic flow is problem
mission which kind of includes narratives goals challenges and strategies and projects. These are kind
of the core. And what's really cool about this structure here is that when you have a
project on this list, you know why you're doing the project because it's
part of one of these strategies for addressing one of these challenges,
which is trying to get you to this goal, which takes you to your mission. So you have explanability all the way from what
you're physically tangibly doing dayto-day all the way up to your mission and the problem you're trying to solve.
So it's explanability is like a really big deal here. Um I think I actually
updated this one. Yep. I switched it to Austin. Um yeah. So you can give it like
uh history and you could put as much as you want here. My Tilos file is 2,100
lines. So, it's it's a lot uh deeper than this one, but um this is just an example because
it doesn't need to be that uh complex when you first start out. So, problem
one. So, this is an example of somebody that uh your channel or my channel might
want to solve. Not enough people understand how to build secure open-source software,
right? um because that's a problem I've identified. Maybe my primary mission is
to create and promote a standard for building secure open source software. Well, now I can explain to my
mother-in-law or the janitor or somebody where I'm
interviewing or anybody. I can explain to anybody what I'm about. Now, the
narratives piece is essentially how I would explain myself. I maybe you don't
have this problem, but I I sometimes get in like a low energy mood and I'm just like I think all my ideas are stupid. Um
I I think like none of my projects are going well and I'm about to walk into um
a big party in San Francisco where it's a bunch of really smart people, right?
Who I'm supposed to be peers with. Excuse me. But at this particular
moment, I can't remember any of my cool ideas. I'm like, they invited me because they
think I'm smart. Like I don't know anything. So you literally can use this to remind yourself of who you are
because it's captured in the form the better form of what you are, right? And
I'm going to show you some ways to use AI to actually extract that out um using uh some fabric stuff. So these are kind
of like what you would say. So this is like literally an opener. I am the author of a platform that helps people
create secure software. Well, now the conversation's off and running, right? Um, and this is a longer version
which um comes from this concept uh called uh the most important sentence,
which in my opinion is a really important sentence for everyone to have. I believe a really important problem in
the world is which is why I'm building or creating
this. M and if you if you just can answer that
cleanly, then you're like you're off to the races in terms of like self-discovery.
So you go ahead. Sorry to interrupt. Uh so narrative one, narrative two, those are both tied to
problem one. Is there any kind of linkage to creating multiple problems and multiple narratives? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
So you can have Yeah, I would say mission is like the main one that you want to have like one or two, maybe
three, but M1 should be your main one. But narratives you can have as many as you want and they can because a really
good question they can address different uh problems.
Okay. Okay. And do you find so like for me I'm immediately going okay I have a
very distinct mission I feel like for my work but then a very distinct mission
for my personal life. Do you find that you would create multiple tilos files or
would you try to keep that all in one? I would keep it all in one, but um I have
had sections in it where um I just put personal uh missions and personal goals
and stuff like that. You you just break them uh because these are like um H2s. I
would just break those into H3s and have the things as subcomponents. Okay. Yeah. I I keep thinking of like a
very structured thing, but like you can you can break it up as much as you want. the AI is going to read it however you you give it to it.
That's right. That's right. Yeah. And and that is a good way to do
it. Um there's also another way to think about that is um kind of similar to what
you just said, the goals. There's urgency and then there's importance. So some of my goals, for
example, are like uh I would like to be uploaded at some
point. Uh it's it's not like a it's not like a major concern for me right now. I'm not like you know I'm not spending
any effort on trying to well I guess I am spending effort on capturing myself but not for the purpose of like
uploading. Um so I it's like very very important because it has to do with like
death but I'm not even going to start it for 20 years. So maybe there's a separate H3 under goals
where it indicates that you don't start it until later and the AI will just figure that out. Okay. So one second, we can't just
breeze past that. When you say uploaded, I have an idea of what you might mean, but can you define what it means
exactly? Uh yeah. Um,
so imagine taking like your genome, um, all your life experiences, like as many
recordings as you could possibly get, um, all the different artifacts you produced, your journal or whatever, and
um, I don't know, maybe a brain scan. It depends on where science is at the time, and just be like, okay, I'm 112, I'm
dying, like all my body is shutting down. Um, but I am looking at the new
model of the uh AG 947B,
which is like some representation of me in this uh robotic android form. Or
maybe they don't have good enough robots for that. And you just go into a brain
into a mind or or a storage facility or whatever. Maybe you're waiting for a physical body. Or maybe you don't even
want a physical body and you just want to explore things and uh be curious in in the ether.
What's what's so terrifying about what you just said because it's wild is that it's not that fantastical anymore.
No. No, it's not. Even 5 years ago this was kind of ridiculous
and now it's like a lot less ridiculous. Um yeah, it's not a huge priority for
me. Um, but yeah, it it's worth capturing in the TLOS file. I'm of the same mind. Like the the way I
do my second brain stuff now is with the the effort to know that one day all of this can be captured into some kind of
persona, AI, whatever you want to call it, that my grandkids can talk to. Yep. That's it.
Yeah, absolutely. Um, okay. So, narratives is kind of like
Yeah, like like I said, quick handles for how you can explain it to other people. And this is a very tactical
thing that you could use in parties or whatever. Um,
all right. So, goals is very very clear. This one's pretty obvious. Uh, everyone has these. Um, so this person is
basically building this uh Oh, there's a big podcast that this person wants to get their Secure Code software like out
into the world. And like this is fake, by the way. This is made up. But let's
say there's a podcast called Secure Code Warrior and whatever they have 10 million followers and uh they're trying
to get this idea out there. So this is one of their goals. They also want to get this many downloads on GitHub of the
thing. Also, they're not married yet. They want to have a wife and kids by like 36.
So pretty simple captures here. And again, you can have three of these. You
can have 20 of these.
Challenges are very specifically the things stopping you from making
progress on these. Um so for example I have in my thing
sometimes I feel like just unmotivated and lazy and I don't work out and I
don't get sun I don't go for a walk. So, it's literally my C1
and I've got multiple other challenges listed. Um, but here we have like I'm
having trouble building the UX for the for the product. Uh, someone has a
similar product and it's actually freaking me out because they're getting traction and it's motivating me. Um, and
yeah, I don't know how I'm going to start a family because I don't know how to meet any uh potential wives,
right? So these directly and in fact when you start doing visualizations they can actually point to the things because
it'll figure that out. Um
and you can also capture additional um additional context. In fact I highly
recommend you capture lots and lots of additional context. So this is just things to make the AI smarter about you.
Things I've been wrong about. uh special ideas that I have um or ideas that at
least I think they're special. Um I've got predictions that I'm I'm guessing
are going to happen. Um best movies, so it's learning your personality. Best books. Um your favorite sort of wisdom
and knowledge because that's also going to train it um on your personality.
These are the metrics which are very very much tied to the goals. um if you want to and you got to be
careful about this since we're you know security people um you got to figure out which AI you're
using. You got to be very cautious about which AI you're using um to do this
analysis. Is it like Chuck who has this uh local stack running at home or are
you using thirdparty AI to do this? Because if you have a whole bunch of personal stuff in here,
um, which I do in mine, I have my journal in mine as well. Plus, I got stuff in
history, then, um, it's great to be able to use a pinnacle model because they're very
smart and you can ask it questions like, hey, be my psychologist or whatever. But you have to realize you are sending that
to a third party and you just have to be aware of the the possibilities there. So, that's kind of the the main
structure there. Any questions on on that? Yeah. So, on the journal side, you said
you have your journal in there. Yeah. My journal is I mean, it's just a massive block of text every single day.
What does yours look like? Mine is just lines of text. Um, it's not
that massive. Um, although sometimes I do uh voice notes, so it ends up being a
pretty nice block. Um, but it is literally a date, timestamp, and then
just text and all the way down to like eight words of text.
Really? All the way up to like 500 words of text.
Huh. Okay. I'm just trying to think about my workflow. Like in my workflow, I I keep a daily note and I just kind of
like I'll jot down, hey, I just exercised and then I might have a conversation with someone. So, I'll mark down the conversation and then I have a
meeting. I'll probably I'll probably have an entry in my daily note of this right here. Um, so I'm just trying to
think about like would I somehow try to extract that into the the TOS file or let it be its own thing?
Uh, no. I I would definitely bring it into the TLOS file because the reason is you're going to be talking about things
that matter to you in the the journal and they're the same things that are in your TLOS file. So, for example, if
you're like, hey, we finally reached that a thousand downloads on our open source software. Well, it just ticked
off that you crossed a metric. So when you run a metrics analysis now
you see the the graph move and you hit a goal. So I feel like it's the only it's
the best source of signal for whe all the things that you were tracking in your TOS file. Now one thing uh a lot of
people do who use this is um they have a separate journal and then what they do
is when they run their um TLOS they import the import it and append it and
then send that to the AI because they don't actually want to have it always in the TOS file just permanently.
Interesting. Okay. So, I could see that cuz like I'm doing things now with my daily note where I like I wear the Aura
ring now for like track my sleep. So, I'll like an API call that'll throw all my sleep data and how like if I'm
stressed that day into my daily note so I just have a a very great picture, a snapshot of my day. It'd be very cool to
import all that into my toast when I'm analyzing and doing metrics. Yeah. No, absolutely. That that's kind
of the dream. Um, I'm not working on that one actively because I know um
that's mostly going to be a Google or a Apple thing where they they're the ones pulling that stuff in through the APIs.
Uh, but once that's available, yeah, that's absolutely going to be pulled in for this analysis.
Do you what I'm not up to date on it, but what's our context limit right now?
Um, so the new model that just came out from Google yesterday is a million tokens. Holy um 2.5 is a million.
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah. A million uh a million input tokens and 64,000
uh output tokens. Wow. Yeah, it it's getting like it's getting
pretty serious. And I think uh Sonnet are still 200,000 input I think.
Um but I think it might also be 200,000 output tokens. Uh so they are growing
quite fast which I'm really excited about. That's uh absolutely insane. Yeah.
The bigger we can get on the context the the more it's impactful for people like you and me and everyone honestly. If you
can import everything you're doing and have and give it ultimate context on who you are that's that changes the
game. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I I can't wait till it's just like, you know, trillions of
tokens or millions, which I I don't I don't think that'll be too long before it's probably millions. Um, and the
prices it's ridiculous how the prices keep coming down. Mhm. Now, do you with with your te So,
like for me, I'm like, cool, context could become so large it doesn't matter. But also, I'm like maybe I can tweak
this and do some kind of rag setup. Do you have any ideas for that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, right now I'm
mostly using pure text context for the tilos file itself, but I do use rag for
multiple other things such as um all the content that I put out. So like for you,
I would recommend trans getting a transcript of every video and then uh
putting that into a uh a vector database so you can query it.
And then so do you connect that I mean obviously you connect to an LLM and how how do you integrate that with your
processes? I do you have that in in use with your TOS file at all or is it mainly just a separate process for your
business? Yeah. So um that is a that is a oh we should we
should talk about my whole AI infrastructure. So essentially Yeah. So so um
yeah we we could do a whole whole thing on this. Um essentially I have services
uh API services that are available in the cloud to do individual tasks like
fetch information um run uh fabric queries against my tilos file give the
results uh do a lookup against my rag for all the content I've ever created
and the cool thing about it is they're all pipable just like fabric so the output of one can be the input of
the other and then sitting in front of it is an agent and the agent has as the
tools every single one of those services. So I could say um
I I could say like uh when did I write about AGI uh for example um into this one agent
and it will hit a knowledge base and pull that answer back. If I ask it um to
summarize a news story and I give it the news story, it will look and see if
there's any tool that does news summaries, which it will find because I have a a schema in there with a tool
definition and it goes and runs against that service. So essentially, I'm
looking to be like a little bit superhuman in about four months when uh I'm having a current
issue right now with my platform um automatically calling the agent uh
because it does it's kind of boring. It's multiple subprocesses, but um it's
the one thing that this uh platform doesn't have is an invoke agent function. But once I solve that,
um, I'm just going to keep adding more and more services. So, literally like
because I talk to Jason about this all the time, um, and reszo, a bunch of other people. If somebody is like, "Hey,
I wonder, you know, if there's any new VMS on Tesla, we'll just use Tesla because I know they have an open
bounty." I will literally say um into my AI, hey so and so
um go do a quick assessment on Tesla and send me the results.
It will parse that. It will go get all subdomains. It will do start start doing
reverse discovery. it will do like nine different services which all point to my
individual security services but it's calling the different nine because it knows what I asked for and then I have
uh Amazon SCES set up where it takes that goes to um another LLM which
creates the um security summary report very simple call and then it sends to
Amazon SCS and while we're still walking or we're still in this conversation
my email will just pop up and I will have an assessment on what's it called. Now, you want to go crazy level, which
this this is going to take a little bit more time, like maybe another two months. Um,
how hard is it to say, um, and find out if they have a bug bounty program and
submit these vans? My service already has the format that
it uses to submit vaults. It already has the volms. It can find the address for
for the bug bounty program. So now I tell it to monitor and watch for results
from there and send me if I get any money.
And now Okay, so I have like 13,000 questions. I'll only ask two though. Um,
what platform are you using for your agent? Is this lang chain? Bedrock. Bedrock. Okay.
Yep. Amazon built-in agents. Yeah. So, Amazon, yeah, it's their
unified AI program. Uh, so, uh, the other one I'm using is N8N. Have you
seen that one? That's on my list. So, you're using that actively now, huh? Yeah.
Okay. I need to bump that up on my list then because I I've been hearing so much about this. I've seen it, but I've been
dabbling in the textbased stuff first, like doing crew AI, about to jump into a lang chain. But nan, I don't know what
you call it. N8 n seems very amazing. It is. It's It's completely insane. It's
um I I don't Do you remember Yahoo Pipes? Uh no. Yeah, it was it was this visual thing
where like you take an RSS feed and you create a hook and it goes down to this other visual thing and you can divide up
the RSS feed. It's kind of like Yahoo Pipes. It's a visual editor for agent
workflows. So you literally connect all your different services and just pipe them into these pipelines. It's
completely insane. Um, so I'm really excited about that one. I'm excited
about Amazon because they have so many engineers working on it and it's designed to be production ready. So,
it's like I kind of experiment with NADN and build the stuff and have it work and
then I essentially try to migrate it over to um to Bedrock where it could be
like enterprise ready. Interesting. So, I've never used Bedrock. Is it like a a UX or is it all
command line? What tools are they giving you? So, it is um knowledge bases. It is
prompts. It's guard rails. So that um you have like uh prompt injection
defenses. You can um filter out responses from an LLM to make sure they're not talking about something
sensitive. Um you can manage your prompts there kind of like think of like a fabric in the cloud. You can have like
a set of prompts. Yeah. Um but more importantly you can stack it
together with uh what Amazon calls step functions. So step functions are essentially what
NADN is. I feel like NADN is more accessible and like I don't know it's
just it's just hotter and moving faster. Um but step functions is the version uh
from AWS. Now combined on top of that they have agents.
So agents can co oh and oh the other piece of this is like most of my services are lambdas. So lambda lambda
is an individual service, right? An individual API. So the lambdas are
available as services. They can be part of a workflow which is like an edn which
is called a step function. Then you have the agent. It can call all of them. It
understands all of them. Then you build your knowledge base inside of nadn or
bedrock or wherever. Oh, and by the way, if you're going to do lang chain, um, just skip right ahead to lang graph.
Oh, yeah. It's by the same people, but it is more of it's more of an agent workflow
thing. Lang chain is like the uh like the initial version of it, but lang
graph is like up upgraded. And did you ever touch crew AI? I did. I did. Um, yeah, I'm excited
about it. I I know the founder guy. Um he he's really cool. But um
what I found Yeah. what I found from Crew AI is like
it just kind of gets ahead of itself and goes and does lots of different stuff, but it doesn't stay along a path that I
can uh predict and predictably get the output of to use in the next step. M
because what I'm trying to do is um I I'm building workflows. So So the same
same way I'm sure you're thinking about this is the way I think about it is like in a conversation somebody mentions
something I want to research that thing. I want to find all books related to it. I want to order those books. I want them
to show up. So I literally have a uh diagram of all things that I do in my
life. All those workflows I am not happy until
all of those are individual services that are available to my agent. So when
I say the words, my agent does those things for me.
So I will be walking through life with like a thousand people behind me ready to research any topic. So, if somebody's
like, "Hey, did you know so and so like um they're actually kind of dirty because they they um they got donated by
whatever big sun um industry and then they got this one dinner and blah blah
blah. I'll just be like, "Hey, did you hear that? Go see if that's true."
Boom. Research. Boom. Research. Deep research calls Gro 3. Calls uh Google
Gemini. pulls all this stuff together. Oh, and by the way, the primary service
that you have to have, like the number one that that I built is um a scraper. You have to have a scraper
because when someone claims that like let's say a politician went to a dinner with so- and so, those are publicly
declared. They can't be behind a payw wall. It's a public site. So, the thing just literally goes off for 19 minutes
while we're having a coffee and it comes back and it says, um, yes, that actually
did happen. And here's the evidence. And I'm just like, check it out. Now, uh, are you using like SER AI for
scraping or what are you? No, no, I'm using uh, Gina Gina.ai is
one of the services that I'm using. And then um, I've got a custom workflow as
well that does uh, just like Selenium Playright stuff, but I really like Gina. So, if you
append Gina to any URL, you get back markdown. Oh, wow. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's crazy good. And it actually has a deep research
assistant as well. So you could so you could literally like put in a topic, send it to Gina,
it will do all the queries and basically do what like a deep research does and return you back markdown of all the
results, dude. Okay. Like you've broken my brain a few times already. Um
for No, I had one question. uh the agent you're using. Um
so this is an Amazon thing. What LLM is it based on? Is it can you choose? Yeah, you just swap it out.
Okay. And is it a crew AI agent? You just give it a prompt, who it is, what it's about, that kind of thing.
Yeah. So, so the core things for all agents is like a prompt like you said, an LLM and then uh the tools. The most
important thing is the tools. Yeah. you have to define a schema for
how it understands uh the tools. Um yeah, I'm I'm also uh going to be adding
a bunch of uh MCPs that are actually services. I literally wrote that down as you were saying because I'm like he's got to be
thinking about MCP right now. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So, so this this is a thing that I talk a lot about with uh
Jason, but like um basically traditional applications are not really accessible unless you
hire a developer to create an API for it. What an MCP essentially does is it
turns everything into an object, every application into an object that has an API and in listed services. And for me
that is amazing because I'm just going to turn that into another service that my agent can use.
So, so I I'm literally like moving through life figuring out a thing that I wish existed. Then I'm like, how can I
turn that into a service? Oh, I need an API key. I need a crawler. Blah blah blah. Boom. Service is live.
The backend system just got upgraded with a new with a new capability, a new feature.
This is we live in the weirdest age. Like I was just talking with Jason. It's like we can do whatever we want right now.
And really like our our imaginations are the limit. Like I'm like I I can't even begin to think about what I like I I'm
I'm like I feel so tied. It's time. Time is our biggest limit right now. Like we just can't I don't have the time to build all the
stuff I want to build. Yeah. Yeah. And and that's what's
well actually I'm I'm going to show my to at some point. Um this is why I'm so focused on this this
thing of like building this backend infrastructure because what happens is when I sit down with my blueberries at
night um to watch YouTube, I'm going through all the things and they're
talking about the latest shiny. Oh, Google uh 2.5. Um, like you've got to go
check out Flash 2.5. It's smarter than any of the other ones or whatever. They're everything is so shiny right
now. You could just be pulled in all these directions and then two and a half months later you're like, what exactly
did I do? It's like, did I actually roll out any
of these projects? Did I I tweeting isn't like I didn't ship anything when I
tweeted about it. Like did I make anything? So my methodology now is when
I learn I upgrade my augmentation system. When I learn a thing, I upgrade my
augmentation system. It becomes a new capability. Um so I'll give you a good
example which is way way in the future like five years or whatever. Um
let's say um Meta comes out with a new augmentation class. Well, well, that's actually not too far out. But let let's
say that it can present anything in my eye. As I'm looking at you in the coffee shop, I could see any sort of thing
here. Um, and let's say that my particular city has uh CCTV cameras for
like stuff going on all around the city and they're all public view because it's public money or whatever. Um, and I
write one of my services to be pull camera feeds. So when someone texts me and says, "Hey,
did you hear um there was a car crash by the uh farmers market, I could literally
say, "Show me what happened." So So it calls the service. It shows me
a picture of what happened at the farmers market. Like
I'm starting from the primitives of what I wish I could do. Mhm.
When I learn a new thing, I turn that into a service and add it to the augmentation stack.
Gosh, the augmentation stack. What a crazy phrase.
Oh my gosh. Yeah. And just just imagine like imagine that you have this and I have
this and Jason has this and we're sitting in a in a coffee shop
four years from now. You literally have a giant swarm of agents that can do
anything for you. And we're having a conversation about like starting a business. We're having a conversation
about, "Oh, we should do a conference together. Oh, we should do whatever." Meanwhile,
hundreds of services are being fired off in the background. They're creating PDFs for us. They're finding someone to staff
to run the conference. Like work is being done as we are thinking and like
interacting in real life. Not scary, but amazing.
You know what's scary about it to me is that you and me and Jason will have it
and a lot of people won't. True. Yeah. That that's one thing I I'm
surprised about still because and I asked Jason this question yesterday. I'm
like the people who come to your class, are they familiar with AI? Like do they already know it? Like are they cutting edge? He's like, "No, no. Most of just
have just dabbled in chat GPT and they want to know how to use it better." And I'm like, "Yep, that's cuz like I'm I'm so entrenched. I
forget that most people don't even know what the heck we're talking about." Right. So, you're right. Like, people are not
ready at all. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, people talk about inequality and like uh unequal
capabilities. people who read a lot and watch a lot of YouTube about smart topics or whatever,
they're already have a massive advantage over people who are just kind of restricted in what they see and what
they learn and stuff. There's a big disparity there. The disparity between
having this giant automated staff behind you. Mhm. That disparity. I mean, think think of
you as a regular employee or me as a regular employee doing regular programming work when I have this thing
sitting over my shoulder. I just so I I know for me like when I
hear you describing this, I'm like thinking to myself, I don't know if I could do or build what Daniel has built.
Like I I don't know if I could augment it correctly. I would be constantly trying to tweak my augmentation stack
and never getting any real work done. I would be so stressed about that trying to make sure my AI is up to snuff
compared to everyone else's AI. Yeah. Do you feel that pressure or are you
I feel the pressure now because I don't have it fully built. Like I've got probably like 18 services right now and
there's like a whole bunch more and plus my agent hook is not perfectly
working because of that AWS issue. Um, and I've got some separate issues with
like NAD. It I just feel like it's so early. It's okay to be stressed about it.
Um, and besides that, I mean, I I would
literally tell my AI whenever you see me stressing about this, like make sure I don't stress about it. Like, I mean,
that would be part of the tilos management is like, stop trying to optimize your augmentation stack.
Yeah. Yeah. That I need that 100%. Well, how do you talk to your agent? You said you have an a problem with the invoke
because I'm assuming you have some kind of like API call out from some kind of terminal you're in.
Yeah. So, um I have an Apple shortcut which calls a Zapier uh web hook and the
web hook sends into an API and the API kicks off any um NAD structure, any uh
Lambda, any step function or the agent. Okay. Guess you're like doing a voice
note and you're like, "I need to know this." Boom. Goes off. Wow,
that's crazy. Yeah. Or or um if I do,
if I say um the person's name and then it'll capture that and put it into a
Google doc appended uh to get ready for the show. Um so, so I I don't forget it
when I do the newsletter on Monday. Wow. Okay. See, I I'm trying something
now that's still very very bad, but I'm trying to do some pre-editing when I
record my videos for my editors. So, like I'll do like AI editing notes and I'll like make a note about this. So,
like when they get the video, it's full of notes and I'm trying to get it to where I can import it into Premiere and
like have it all designed out eventually getting to a point where the uh AI can do some of the editing for me with
FFmpeg before it gets to my editor so they can just be freed to focus on the creative aspect. Sure. I'm
trying to figure that part out. But it's it's it's hard to do this work, too. Like, while AI is so incredible, it is
it's hard to to make it work correctly, exactly the way you wanted to. Yeah, definitely. And so I I basically
like keep a list of these um these capabilities and some of the capabilities are just too far down. Like
um that's a good example, the one you just gave, like AI just can't do it. And
so like I'm not going to bash my head against the wall like trying to force it when it's just not possible today. I
I'll wait two and a half years and then I'll see some product that comes out that does it and I'll be like, "Okay, I'm going to go roll my own turn into a
service." Are you using any kind of browser use agent or computer like anything with
visual um interaction control of your computer or a browser? Um no. Um I I sampled like four of them.
um the Claude one, the OpenAI one. Um but the one thing I'm not comfortable
with is um I I've got four screens here. I'm I'm
texting all my friends. I've got uh find my friends over here. It's just it's not
only my data that I'm I'm sharing. Okay. Right. So I I don't want a friend to
send me some crazy joke or a crazy picture or they mention something about
work or something and then this is all being uploaded to some third party
startup and because I do security for startups I know they don't have security people so it gets compromised and I'm
not so worried for myself but what in there is about my friends. True. Yeah. So browser use yet? It's an
open source one that runs locally. Oh, you talking about the browser use tool? Yeah, I use that inside of client.
Okay. Um, yeah. So, um, oh, no, no, no. As far
as like a browser agent, no, I I've not used that one. Um, there's this thing called browser tools.
It's really powerful. So you put Yeah, you put it inside of Klein and it could read any web web page that you build.
Basically helps you troubleshoot faster. Are you now before we get back to Tilos
and and by the way, do do you have time? No, I got time. Yeah. Okay, cool. I do too. Um before we get
back to Tilos, uh are you still like in Neoim? Is that is that still where you
live? Oh, yes. Okay. Cuz I know people are jumping to warp. They're staying in Cursor now. And
um I just I don't like all the new tools. I want to stay in the command line. I don't want to leave.
Yes. Right there. Yes. I'm really kind of upset about it honestly because Klein and like I spend
a lot of time in cursor and in Klein. Uh and whenever I click over to the code
area inside of Visual Studio, I hate myself. I literally hate myself. I I mean I have
the Vim plugin installed which is honoring my NeoVim config but inevitably I try to do something and
it just doesn't work and I'm like why am I in a guey editor? I do not like myself right now.
I just I don't like it. I don't like it. So, what I'm really hoping for,
there's a few that that are already pretty decent AI agents, but I'm just waiting for Neoim to get something
almost equivalent and then I'm all in. Have you tried Cloud Code yet?
Yes. Yeah. Is that kind of what we're looking for? Um,
I would say it is except for Cloud Code is almost like a mini shell because you're like inside of that environment.
So, I don't feel like I would have full access to my my real shell and my real Vim inside of there.
Okay. Yeah. I feel like it's a little bit too um sandboxy.
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that. I've seen that. I get that. Yeah. I'm kind of like you. I'm waiting for a truly uh native
command line AI assistant that can help us with and I don't necessarily want anything that can like manipulate my files for me
or like for example I don't want it to do Linux commands because I I I want to keep that but I do want to have like a
full code editor AI assistant like cursor with me. I know like warp and the
other ones they will try to do Linux commands for you and like ask for confirmation. I'm like oh I don't I
don't like that yet. Yeah, that's just the old person in me like saying no, don't you can't take my Linux commands. It's just dope things for me.
Yeah, I feel the same way. Like the first time I spun up Warp and I I'm like
this is the prettiest gooey ever, I tried like two commands. I'm like I'm never coming back here again.
That was me. It was like it was like it was like started doing something fancy. I'm like
uh get me out of here. That's exactly what I did. I think I did two commands and I'm like I can't even
sucker. Like, what's going on? Get me out of here. Yep. Yep. I was like, I'm impressed, but
I'm never coming back. All right, cool. Well, I've derailed this enough. Let's get back to Tilos.
Okay, cool. So, so this is um the markdown view of things.
So, if we go over here to who
a vis a visual, you got something like this. So this is the way I recommend
people put things in. Um you do it in this is
Excaladraw. Uhhuh. Um but I also have and I'll show this
one later. Uh this is free form by Apple. So it's just visual like whatever. Um but this
is a great way to just visually see everything and and think about it. So if
we start at the top, this is the same uh roughly the same content as uh the
markdown file we looked at. So top level is like understand yourself, be able to explain yourself, know exactly what
you're working on and why, and then be able to manage it with AI. So you have your problems and you have your thing
and then you just copy paste and add items. And when I do these kind of uh
workshops with my friends, this is what I do. I take mine or I take this uh base
and then I just swap their stuff in and out. And uh we start up here. This is
kind of most important. The mission statement is a little bit hard to actually that one you can massage later.
It's not super important, but these are important because they give you confidence to like move in the world and
talk about what you're about. So, um, start with the problems,
narratives, hopefully lock down the mission, move into the goals,
highlight your challenges, and again, these are all C, C1, C2, C3 because the
AI natively just knows that C1 is more important. Um, and these strategies you could
actually do something um like this and like link these
um so you could you could link this to uh to this if you wanted to, but really
most of the time these link to multiple so I I just kind of keep them unlin.
Um but it's usually somewhat obvious like which one it is mostly addressing.
Um, so yeah, I don't have time to work on the
thing. That that's this one, right? Um, stop caring about emotional drama at
work. Again, that's also this one. Uh, features the other project has. That's
this one. So, you're essentially building strategies to address your challenges. The idea is if you didn't
have these, you would be achieving these a whole lot faster. Mhm.
Um then once you have your strategies, like you don't do projects that aren't
tied to a strategy. Oh, and there's a cool way I think about strategies is like
because there's a million different definitions. My super simple definition of a strategy is a very specific way
that you are addressing a challenge. Okay, I like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I think it's
fairly elegant. So a challenge would be like, you know, they have 10,000 troops, we have 1,000 troops. It's a flat open
space. If we fight directly, we're going to lose. So strategy would be like scare
them with scary sounds at night, buy camouflage, only attack at night, become ninjas, do do something.
So this is a specific bypass of a challenge. Um, and then the projects, they fall out of the strategies.
Um, and like I was saying in the beginning, what's cool about this is
when someone's explaining to themselves or they're explaining to someone else, it could be a boss, a co-orker,
whatever. It's like, hey, why are you working on so- and so, why are you doing that project? Because it's part of this
strategy to overcome this, which is stopping me from doing that, which helps me achieve this, which solve
this problem. Okay. Now I are are you saying that ideally
like everything we do that's more than just like an afternoon of wasting time? Everything we do should be a project if
it's any anything kind of meaningful or long term. I would say yeah meaningful and longterm. Um I I would put tasks as like
a separate thing which is more like an agenda item. Ideally all your tasks would be part of a project but that's
just not how reality works. we have like million errands and stuff to run. But I
would say what you said meaningful and long-term it should probably be a project.
Okay. And then the real question for all of these is
and this is what's cool about this is you'll end up with like 14 of these things and then when you're like you
find yourself massively stressed you're like hold on time for some soularching. How are these actually these 14 things
actually tied to these? And sometimes what this is what's really cool about the the TLO system is like
you'll find out that the answer is yes, these are actually really important. Two
of these are actually really important. And no, they don't actually tie to the goals, which means you need to add,
remove, adjust a goal, right? because something further down
might reveal that something higher up needs to change. Okay, I like that. So, constant
reflection, constant iteration. Yep.
Um, yeah, absolutely. So, for yourself, how often do you revisit this?
I would say at least monthly. Um, and plus I'm doing like updates in the
journal. Um, but I would say one to two months I'm actually looking at the
strategy and goals and stuff like that just to just to see if it's if I'm doing
anything wrong. Um, the big one that I do is in December. That's when I update my Neov config, my uh, raycast, all my
tools. Um, I kind of redo all productivity stuff and there I do a
complete recaning of Tila's file. Oh, okay. And that probably takes you
days, right? Uh for the TOS file, honestly, probably just a couple of hours.
Oh, okay. Yeah, because I will have been maintaining it uh the whole time um in
the journal, right? So, the evidence is there in the journal, the evidence is there in other places like perhaps it's
in a visual form, but it's not yet in the markdown form. So, it's just a matter of just making
those updates. Okay. Okay. Is there, and I'm just kind
of thinking out loud here, is there a more elegant way to link projects to strategies to challenges to goals to
where an AI can easily reference that? And I'm thinking in terms of like Obsidian where we have the built-in linking. Um, do you have a strategy yet
for how we could have an AI analyze that linking? Yes. Yes. So, um, so I I'm not a huge
fan of the manual linking. I want the AI to do it for me. Oh. Um, so, so basically the better I
describe these different things, the the easier it's going to be for it to actually do it. So, this is the file
here, and these just have natural links um in
them, right? So, inside of here, this is a fabric, which um you've already got an
excellent video on. Uh, thanks again for that. Um these are these T underscore patterns
are all TOSS related patterns inside of TLOS. Okay. Are these
inside of fabric? Oh, so are these in the the public repository? Oh, yeah. Okay.
Yeah, absolutely. So, what that allows you to do is stuff like this. So, cat personal
tilos. Of course, that's going to cat it out. Oh, by the way, have you have you switched cat to bat?
No, this is what bat gets you. What is it doing differently? You see the line numbers and the
formatting? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, so it's like less but like
it's like less but for cats and it's called BAT. So, I just alias it. Um,
so I could do things like, um, let's say somebody hits you up and, uh,
they're like, "Hey, uh, are there any panel topics? I want you to be on a panel. Are there any topics you could
possibly talk on?" So I created one called extract panel topics and it's
just going to figure out from your TLOS file and you can literally copy these and paste them over in the email,
right? Um this one's really cool. Create opening
sentences. So again, you're going into that party, you're concerned, you're worried about um
I I can't remember if I'm smart at all, right? Yeah. So it's like different
approaches for like starting a conversation and and of course after the
conversation starts, like I'm a little introverted, so um this stuff can help
me sometimes. I'm the exact same way. And that's what people are always surprised to find out being a YouTube personality. Like if you
meet me in person, I'm very uh I'm more low energy and after about an hour of
talking to you, I want to leave immediately. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Um yeah. When
I'm in the moment, I'm like, I'm okay. And then the moment it dies down for a
second, like to go get a coffee or something, I'm like, I just have to be alone. Uhhuh. Yeah.
Just got to get out of here. So you could do things like uh check metrics
which I don't think this person is doing too well on the uh family front
but ju just imagine all of these here again it goes back to that automation
stack. All of these can be running in an automated way all the time.
And and basically you can create a dashboard off of this if you wanted to to be like what is my current state? Um
you could have one fire off a prompt of like what is the lowest hanging fruit?
What is the thing I should be working on? I got give encouragement.
You're feeling down about yourself or whatever. Find neglected goals. Find blind spots in my thinking, threat model
my plans. Oh, that's cool. See, this this is kind of
what people like, and I'm already doing this, too. You know, I'll use the chat GPT interface with the built-in memory
to kind of do some of this, but it's very very um sparse for what it knows about
you based on your random conversations, and it's not thought out. So, this is way better.
Yeah. So, so I mean this just goes back to the fabric thing. It's like once you
figure out a cool thing that you would do in chat GPT, just capture that and turn it into a thing and now it becomes
a pipeline that can run against your tilos. Um, so uh describe life outlook
um create an H3 career. So it's like build me a career that isn't based on
this corporate grinding structure like what could I possibly do to work for
myself which is what the create H3 career is. Find negative thinking find
neglected goals. Yeah. Red team thinking. This is fascinating
man. And so, um, oh, by the way, so do you have all these fabric patterns as some kind of API,
some kind of service for your agent to access? Um, I don't have these individualized
yet. No. Okay. Um, do you have fabric running like
inside N8N somehow? Like is is Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. So basically um I have a lambda that runs it. So it can call individual
ones. Um the the biggest thing that I do is just run prompts through actually I
can call the uh GitHub URL directly so that when the uh the uh pattern gets
updated in fabric it actually gets the update in my lambda. Oh okay.
Yeah. Very cool man. We'll have to do a video where we'll walk through your entire process because like that I think people
would be very interested in that because with AI being so it's so open-ended.
Everyone's like I really don't know how to put all these things together. So just seeing examples would be really helpful. Yeah, I'm looking forward to doing that.
I I would love to do that with with you. Um I'm I'm guessing three to four months
I should have this thing. Might actually be like one or two months, but we'll see. So I I think curiosity is like more
important than intelligence. Um because a thing that Jason and I
actually learned, Jason Hadex and I learned uh when we were at HP training security testers is that um and I didn't
realize this till years later. I I was trying to force the issue, but the people who were the most excited about
learning security turned out to be the best security testers. M.
So, so basically I can't tell the difference between someone who is like, "Oh my god, that's the coolest thing
ever and somebody who is awesome at the thing." There's there's almost no
difference. So, so if that's the case, how do we
become more curious? I think problems are becoming more important than solutions because it's getting easier to
to like execute a process and and get a solution. The question is like who comes up with the questions, who comes up with
the problems and that requires like judgment, right? So you need to know enough about the world to like have an
opinion. Yeah. It it's it's crazy. So it's like because if you can only convey facts and
you don't have opinions about it, then I I feel like people can get the
facts from somewhere else or someone can execute the codew writing from somewhere else or look up the report or write the
report. Um, getting really good at making concise summaries or arguments of anything, I
think, is super key. Um, yeah, be able to explain anything in in either 30
seconds or an hour. Um, yeah, ju just some basic skills. I
don't think we should go through all of them now for for you. Um, so I'm I'm going through a process now where I'm trying
to figure out how to create what's called, you probably heard of this before, um, like atomic notes or um kind
of like distilled notes. So, like as I'm reading, as I'm uh taking notes on videos and ideas, I'll try to go back
through and like distill one thing in my own words that could fit on a note card
about this idea that that's standalone that I could reuse over and over as I create more and more content over the
years. Um, do you have like a method for becoming better at like distilling
ideas, um, processing your opinions? Like do you have a process for that?
Um so the first thing that I do is I always capture immediately. So uh
I never don't capture. I I capture immediately the moment I hear or I think
of something or Yeah. I capture immediately either Apple notes or I've
been carrying these for like 25 years. So index cards.
Oh, okay. And a space pen. Yeah. So, uh the these get issued if you
ever come to the house. Um my close friends get uh a pack of index cards, a
space pen, and actually this knife,
which is like the best knife ever. It is just a razor blade inside of aircraft
aluminum. And you keep this stuff at your house to give to your friends.
I do. I have like Yeah, I I have brand new unopened ones and when they come
over I'm like here's your standard issue um every EDC. I love that. Where are you based by the
way? I I for Yeah, I know you're close to Jason and and uh in um Gosh. Uh
John Hammond. John? Yeah. Yeah, I'm closer to John. Jason's in uh Colorado. I'm in uh the Bay Area
with uh with John. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'll need to you sometime soon
when I'm in the in the area. I'm going to California a few times here in the coming months. So, we'll have to do
something. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I'm just curious like so for me my my
biggest thing is I have no problem uh like finding things that excite me that resonate with me. So, I'll capture that
stuff and that's normally in the form of like if I see an article from you for example, I'll use Readwise to save it
and then I'll highlight it and make some notes on it. that'll get dumped into my obsidian which I'll then go back and review those. But that's just like a
that process is so timeconuming that I usually don't end up doing it. So I'm like, oh,
what what is like for someone like you who's always just coming up with amazing ideas and and and having really great
opinions, how do you get to that point? What's your process? Because I know you're consuming like crazy. How do you
do this? Okay, so great
segue actually because I forgot to show you this. So, um, in fact, I'm going to switch over to my real one. So, I am
always capturing these ideas in that format. So, these become the center of truth for
creating content, which is over here. So, those are going onto here. But it
all streams in from uh so I've got this app called let me show you this app
called threshold. This is doing all my capture. I've got thousands of sources in here. They're all coming in and
getting rated with AI for how good they are. Uhhuh. And then it is um
actually showing me why they're awesome because it's doing AI for the write up. So I'm capturing here. But watch this.
If I click on one of these, so I'm going to click on this, then I'm going to do this keyboard shortcut. You'll see my
arc icon flash. Now, watch this. That just went to one of my lambdas in the
sky. One of my lambdas is a summarizer
uh which can also capture um content from my voice.
So, let me actually see if um Oh, there it is. Just came in. So I basic this
thing is capturing every single thing that I do. So if I go to feedley which is my income source or my input source I
go like this uh Microsoft study boom that just went
up that augmentation stack one of the services is capturing inputs from
anything including my voice. So if I do idea, but it's very much in
line with what you're asking, which is every single input that I have, I don't
want to lose it. Testing one, two, three.
All right. So ideally, if I didn't break that Zapier connection,
so if I have a random idea, I do the idea one. If I capture in an Apple note,
um I can open the link in a what's it called and do that keyboard shortcut and
then it will uh come over to this file. It's basically scrolling. Yeah, I'm not
seeing it. It's unfortunate. Must have turned that off.
Okay. So, it'll just add everything for that day or whatever to this summaries file.
Yeah. I mean, so I I did a newsletter yesterday. I've already got six pages. These are all captures of anything that
I found on my phone or in my browser or
in Feedley. So, I have probably 95% coverage.
Um, and this is just giving me enough to go and research, add more, and then
eventually write something for the newsletter about it. Okay. Okay. So, um, so let me give you
an example of my problem. Maybe you can be a therapist for me. So, like every day I've got current projects I'm working on
for like big YouTube videos, but um, obviously it's the the new stuff that
comes out, the new models, the Deep Seek or whatever it is that if I could make a video about that quickly and uh, get it
out there, that would have a huge impact for my channel. So, my battle every day is like, okay, how do I get the news?
How do I distill it? How do I figure out if it's going to be a good video? If it'll resonate with my audience. How do I How can I figure out if it'll be even
wellreceived in my voice? What could I do with AI to make that happen quickly? Because right now, I'm
just kind of like I I'll look at Google feeds. I might throw a few things to deep research, but I have no defined
process right now to do that. Yeah. So, what you want to do
is create a stack that is pulling in all of your what's it calleds. Uh, it it
depends if you how manual you're going to do it, but um you want to run it
through a a prompt filter that says would this be good content?
So, let me let me show you one of these particular um this is kind of what threshold is loosely based off of.
uh which you might have seen before. Let's see. Yeah, you gave me access a while back. I never really uh got into it to
label and rate. You want to do this for your videos
or for for content that's coming in. So, basically, one of your services should be um find content content or find uh
source content or whatever. And then what you will do is label and rate
whether or not that particular thing that just came in is worth you making a video on. Let let me show let me show
you how that would work. What do we look at? We looked at this right here. Mhm. I've got a thing I could I could
summarize this this thing live and then do do this and automatically
start chatting with the web page. So I could basically have a conversation
with any content I'm looking at. But um let me let me just do this. So um I'm
going to grab this right here and I'm going to go back to this and I'm going to do P pipe FSP label. This is what you
want to be running and obviously a modified version. Look D tier that means you're not making
a video about it. So, if you tune your prompt for this,
let me clean this up for if you tune your prompt around what you
want to make video content on, this thing will literally produce you a JSON that tells you whether or not you should
do it and why. M and so so remember when I when I was in
the browser over here and I do this
when I click this button I'm hitting one of my services. I can change that to hit
this service which does a label and rate which that could go into a separate
um Google doc just like this which means anything that drops into that Google doc
is something you should go make a video on immediately. Okay,
that would be interesting. So, what if um what about something more automated to where I'm not having to go into a
feed and favoring something? Like, I mean, I know it's possible. I just don't know how practical would it be like to
have something that would just 9:00 a.m. every day, I don't know, 6 a.m. go scrape, find something cool, and bring
it back to me. Yeah. Um unfortunately,
um and this is a problem that I'm having on Threshold. Um, it's really hard to scrape YouTube.
They do not like it. Um, I'm looking for like a paid option, but I'm already
doing that automated similar to label and rate with threshold, which you could also do with
your own thing. It is literally going out to all RSS feeds and parsing it automatically. And I get a daily email.
Mhm. So that is solving the exact problem that you're trying to solve. However,
the new blogs are YouTube channels and it's um you could do it all day with uh
what's it called wi with manually. So I I could go right now
uh to YouTube copy. So if you could automate this,
you're fine. See? You see it that that's the transcript.
So what watch this? So this will tell you if that video is worth watching and
worth uh making a thing on. So you could do this for any AI creator to determine whether or not you should go make a
video on it. However, yeah, this is B tier. So ideally you
would make things only if it was over like A tier or S tier or whatever. But
um again, once you hook this up to automation, uh YouTube will notice and
they will turn that off. Interesting. So I could do something I guess like where um maybe have Zapier or
if it like can watch certain creators, they post a video, boom, kick that off,
run this whole scenario, and then tell me if it's worth watching or worth creating content on automatically.
that wouldn't be too too um scanny or spammy to where YouTube would catch up
catch on that I don't think. Um uh it it depends on how many other requests that that platform is running.
So if you got Zapier to watch like 20 channels
uh well its module is running that. So the question is does YouTube allow
Zapier to do that? If they do you're fine. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Now I'm
curious with the label and raid stuff. It's obviously great for looking at other people's content. Do you run your
own content through this? I I do occasionally. Yeah, I do occasionally. Um it's a
little bit cheating because my label and rate um prompt is literally tuned to
stuff I like. Ah, okay. So, it's kind of like putting your finger on the scale. But yeah,
interesting. Yeah, cuz I I deal I mean it better show up high, right? Otherwise, I'm doing I'm doing something
horribly wrong. So, I'm trying to systems to where like I can have a script or or a video rated
before I launch it and tell me like this will resonate based on the comment scraping we've done and your past videos
and performance. We think this will resonate before I post. Oh, yeah. Interesting. I don't know that
there's good enough signal from the video production and like the creative uh camera swaps and stuff that you do. I
don't think AI is smart enough to figure that out and analyze it yet, but
the transcript it could. So that would actually be quite simple. So I get a list of all
your transcripts. We could actually do this if you want. Get a list of all your transcripts and all we need is view
count. And then when I have them, I basically go and get the top
50 or 100 what's it calleds and then I tell it find me the Jono Sequa in this transcript.
Interesting. Okay. Huh. I need to do that because like my my
team is always trying to figure out this problem right before we post. Is it going to resonate? Um we could run this
against ideas. Uh we Huh. Ah, so many ideas. Um, thumbnails, too.
I could have it analyze thumbnails and tell me like why a certain thumbnail performed well. What about it was great. Yep. Yep.
Oh, yeah. There's there's a billion ideas. Gosh, I have no time. Um,
you'll have more time soon when you have a giant staff behind you. That's true. Add an additional giant staff behind
you. That's true. That's true. Yeah. This stuff is is so addicting and so
exciting. Um, we could go down a million rabbit holes. Uh, did we miss anything with Tilos? Uh,
um, I don't think so. I mean, here's another way to look at it. And
this is actually my actual one. So, just to see one that's more filled in here. I got three problems.
um more things under narratives, uh more goals, and yeah, I I just feel
like it's it's very approachable to just sit down and fill this out. In fact, I'm meeting with a a close friend later on
this week, and I basically just took a picture of mine and sent it over and uh
he's filling that in as the template to start the conversation. That's cool. I love that you do that.
You have a servant's heart. Yeah, I I try to. I I feel like it's uh my dad always says uh it's nice to be
nice. It's uncommon though. Um trying to think of anything else I might have questions on. Uh let me check my notes because
I'll normally like make a a checkbox to check in. No, I think we covered about 5 million things and this was all amazing.
Yeah, I feel like the AI stack is is definitely worth the conversation once I have that fully humming. And I do want
to encourage people to do that. I really don't want only us to have this, you
know. Yeah. Yeah. My goal is to try and make it as palatable as possible for someone
to get the spun up and they're not going to ever be as crazy as something that we might produce, but yeah, they can do something small and simple.
They'll get their gears turning to just try and and iterate and add more things. Um, but yeah, I could see this as like
something like this, Tilos and then the augmentation stack itself being a
prerequisite for everyone going through school, going through whatever academy they're a part of. They they need to learn this. It's essential.
Yeah. Yeah, that that's a great point. That that's actually
I would love to sort of close on that because um
yeah I I feel like the current system for most people in most jobs is not going to work anymore and that this is
the path. The path is like this mental switch of like I need to be an originator of ideas,
someone beyond just helping other people um to do a particular task like upload a
spreadsheet or write a report. Um I should feel uncomfortable if I
don't have any ideas of my own. Um and that like you said it doesn't apply to
everyone. I would say for most people they should try to make this mental switch to like no I am good enough. I am
good enough to be a thinker of thoughts or I should be able to have a unique
perspective that someone actually cares about. And then once you have that, you capture using something like Tilos and
then you use something like an augmentation stack to sort of magnify yourself in the world. So you're actually functioning like 10 people or
100 people or a thousand people. And then you're more useful to any company that would want to hire you if you
wanted to work at a company or you could start your own business.
Yeah. Yeah. I I think and I totally agree with everything you just said. Um I'm going to try and experiment like so
at first I'm going to figure out how to explain this in my own words to my team
and see if I can get them to do this because I think they would this would be infinitely valuable. I want them to have
original ideas for my own sake. Yes. how they can impact my company. And then beyond that, like I would love them
to grow beyond me if they figure out, wow, I don't I shouldn't be here at Network Chuck. I should be on my own
YouTube channel doing something else. Like that would that would tickle me to death if they did that. Um or maybe they stay on but they have it
on the side, right? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Uh this is again this this whole this whole process
is it's simple. This it's simple. Well, you know, no, no, not it's not simple at
all. It's It's hard to grasp. It's It's the practicality of it is hard to grasp.
Uh yeah, simple but not easy. I think I've heard someone say it's like, "Yeah, it
seems simple." Yeah. Hopefully, it's more tangible this time than it was last time because we had a decent conversation. I don't think we went into
as much detail as this time. You You feel like we went further enough to make
it more tangible this time? Yeah, I think so. I think so. I think it's something I can um once I walk
through myself, I can systemati system systematize it enough in my own mind to go, okay, I feel comfortable to like
walk someone through this. So, I'm like thinking, let me get my wife in this. Let me get my my um my oldest kids and
have them try it. I'd be really interested to see how they they approach this and see them interact with it would
be interesting. So, like when you walk your friends through this, um what's usually their reaction to it?
Is it like a light bulb or is it like I don't know how do they react? Uh so admittedly most of the people that
I'm doing it with are people who are
um pretty far in their career and already pretty competent at something.
So they already have or had some belief in themselves. And so what I'm largely doing is like
clearing chaos and allowing them to focus. Uh like like if we were to do one
it wouldn't be a lack of ideas. It would be a focus question, right? Um so most of the light bulb for
them is honestly I'm trying to remind them how awesome they are. That's what I'm doing. I'm like, so what I do is I
capture all their ideas and I add the ones if they have have don't remember them. I capture all the stuff that makes
them cool and awesome and unique because often times they'll they'll be like I'm not I'm not that person. So you might do
this with a family member and they're like what are you talking about? You're like you're a YouTuber. Like I'm I'm not
a YouTuber. and you're like, "Don't you have unique perspectives on like how um
children should be raised or what a curriculum should look like in a school?" You start listing these things
and you start writing them down. An hour and a half later, they're looking at this this TLOS document and they're
like, "I am kind of interesting."
And that is what I love to see because then they're like, "Holy crap, I do need to write down my ideas. I could do a
five minute video about a thing, right? And then I don't know, I just I really
love to see that transition in someone going from thinking I could never be that person to Yeah, I guess we all
could be that person. Okay. Okay. That that's that's interesting. Um because I want to see
the same thing too. Like I I know there's people I mean more people than not who especially in my life who don't
have this kind of focus this realization or what they're about. They're just kind of walking around aimlessly like most of
the world. So I would love to see that light bulb moment for them.
So many people don't feel uh valuable. I think this this would be
helpful. Yeah. I I hope so. Well, anyways, uh it's Wow, been two
hours. Um so much for the time, dude. This has been so fun. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Let me know when
