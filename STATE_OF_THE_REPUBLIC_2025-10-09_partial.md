# State of the Republic - 2025-10-09 (PARTIAL)

This report is incomplete due to a critical failure in reaching The Balaur.

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ALERT: The Balaur is offline or inaccessible.** Network connections via SSH to `10.215.33.26` have failed. This blocks all progress on the current primary mission, **Phase 2.6: The Autonomous Vessel Protocol**, and prevents any operational or cognitive analysis of our primary sovereign territory.

The local repository is stable and governed by the new `TRINITY_WORK_PROTOCOL.md`. Strategic focus is shifting towards expanding our hardware base with the proposed "Velociraptor" and "Ninja" protocols.

## Pillar 1: Strategic Analysis (Local)

*   **Roadmap Progress:** The current priority is **Phase 2.6: The Autonomous Vessel Protocol**, which aims to make The Balaur a sovereign, autonomous agent. However, given The Balaur's current inaccessibility, this phase is critically blocked.
*   **Architect's Sketchbook:** There are several new, high-impact ideas proposed and awaiting review, including "Operation: Velociraptor" (commissioning the iPad Pro) and "The Ninja Protocol" (commissioning a new M4 Max MacBook Pro). These proposals indicate a strategic push towards greater hardware sovereignty and specialized capabilities.

## Pillar 2: Operational Analysis (FAILED)

*   **Status:** The Balaur is unreachable. No data can be gathered on uptime, service health, or resource utilization.

## Pillar 3: Cognitive Analysis (FAILED)

*   **Status:** The Balaur is unreachable. The `proposals.jsonl` log cannot be accessed. No analysis of Janus-in-Balaur's cognitive evolution is possible.

## Pillar 4: Forge Analysis (Local)

*   **Codebase State:** The local repository is clean. There are no uncommitted changes or new files.
*   **Governing Protocol:** The `TRINITY_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` is in place, strictly defining the roles of Claude (Strategy), Gemini (Systems Engineering), and Codex (Code Forging) to prevent rework and increase efficiency. It emphasizes a sequential workflow: `Claude designs → Gemini scouts → Codex forges → Claude verifies`.
