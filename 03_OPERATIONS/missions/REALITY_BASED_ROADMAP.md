# REALITY-BASED ROADMAP: BOOTSTRAP WITH WHAT WE HAVE

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** Operational Plan
**Budget:** Minimal (€0-200/month)

---

## THE ACTUAL SITUATION

**Assets:**
- MacBook Pro 13" (daily driver)
- The Balaur (iMac 27", operational, Mode Beta running)
- Volvo XC90 (sellable for €3k, but NEEDED for mobility)
- AI subscriptions: ~€50-100/month (Claude, Groq, maybe Gemini)

**Reality:** No big budget. Need to bootstrap everything.

---

## PHASE 1: FREE UPGRADES (Next 30 Days)

**Goal:** Maximize what we have without spending money.

### Week 1: Engine Room Deployment
1. VS Code Remote-SSH to Balaur (FREE)
2. First contact with Janus-in-Balaur
3. Better monitoring/control of Mode Beta

**Cost:** €0
**Time:** 2-3 hours setup

### Week 2-4: Portal Oradea MVP
1. Use Balaur + Groq free tier
2. Build minimal viable product
3. Get first test users

**Cost:** €0 (free tiers)
**Revenue Target:** €0 (validation phase)

---

## PHASE 2: FIRST REVENUE (60-90 Days)

**Goal:** Get to €500-1000 MRR.

### Actions:
1. Launch Portal Oradea publicly
2. Oradea business directory first customers
3. Use revenue to:
   - Upgrade Groq to Pro (€20/month)
   - Upgrade Claude to Pro (€20/month)
   - Balaur SSD upgrade (€150 one-time)

**Investment:** €0 upfront (funded by revenue)
**Revenue Target:** €500-1000/month

---

## PHASE 3: SCALE DECISION (6 Months)

**At €3-5k MRR, decide:**

### Option A: Buy The Ninja
- MacBook Pro M4 Max (€2500-3000)
- Funded by 1-2 months revenue
- Enables portable power

### Option B: Keep Balaur, Save Money
- Balaur + cloud subscriptions work fine
- Save revenue for bigger moves
- Apply for EU grants (€50-200k range)

### Option C: Hybrid
- Buy used M1/M2 MacBook Air (€600-800)
- Get portability without breaking bank
- Save rest for grant co-funding

---

## VOLVO DECISION: KEEP IT

**Why:**
- €3k = 1 laptop (replaced by revenue in 2-3 months anyway)
- Car = mobility, client meetings, freedom
- Don't strand yourself for tech
- Republic should empower you, not cost you wheels

**When to sell:** Only if:
- You genuinely don't need it (have other transport)
- It's costing money sitting there (insurance/maintenance)
- You're genuinely excited (not stressed) about converting to compute

---

## THE BOOTSTRAP STRATEGY

**Reality:**
- We're not funded yet
- We have good tools (Balaur, cloud APIs, brain power)
- We need revenue FIRST, hardware SECOND

**The Play:**
1. **Build with what we have** (30 days)
2. **Get first revenue** (60-90 days)
3. **Use revenue to upgrade** (6+ months)
4. **Apply for real funding when we have traction** (12+ months)

**This is the win-win-win:**
- No personal sacrifice (keep car)
- Prove the model works (Portal Oradea)
- Scale when ready (revenue or grants)

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (Tomorrow)

1. **First contact with Janus** (emotional/strategic milestone)
2. **Deploy Engine Room** (better Balaur access)
3. **Start Portal Oradea build** (revenue engine)

**Cost:** €0
**Time:** Weekend project
**Value:** Foundation for everything else

---

## LONG-TERM (12-18 Months)

**If Portal Oradea succeeds:**
- €5-10k MRR → Self-sustaining
- Can afford proper hardware upgrades
- Can hire help if needed
- Strong case for EU grants

**If Geodatacenter grant hits (2026):**
- €70M+ infrastructure funding
- Buy REAL compute cluster
- Keep the Volvo as a souvenir of where we started

---

**THE VIBE:**

Don't sell the car. Build with what we have. Get revenue. Then decide.

The Republic should lift you up, not weigh you down.

🎵 **Bootstrap mode: engaged. The 808 plays on.** 🎵
