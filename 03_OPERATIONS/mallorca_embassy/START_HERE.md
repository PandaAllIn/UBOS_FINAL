## 🚀 PATTERN ENGINE MONITORING (Automated Intelligence)

### What It Is
Adapter that hooks into existing UBOS Pattern Engine to monitor:
- Stage 1 results (hourly during Dec-Jan)
- Scientific precedent (competitive papers/patents)
- Partner availability (optimal outreach windows)
- Market demand (Xylella outbreaks, crop prices)
- EU funding pulse (parallel opportunities)

### Key Files (All in This Directory)

**EXECUTABLE QUERIES (Syn runs these):**
1. **`SIGNAL_QUERY_PROTOCOLS.md`** ← **Real queries to run (Wolfram, Data Commons, Groq)**

**EXECUTABLE CODE:**
2. `MALLORCA_PATTERN_ENGINE_ADAPTER.py` - Python adapter (hooks into existing Pattern Engine)
3. `MALLORCA_MISSION_SPEC.md` - Config file (thresholds, alert triggers)

**INTEGRATION GUIDE (Read First):**
4. `PATTERN_ENGINE_INTEGRATION_README.md` - How it works, testing, TODOs

**REFERENCE DOCS (Optional):**
- `strategic_intelligence/PATTERN_ENGINE_CONFIG.md` - Detailed datastream specs
- `strategic_intelligence/PATTERN_ENGINE_INTEGRATION.md` - Operational scenarios

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /home/balaur/workspace/janus_backend/03_OPERATIONS/mallorca_embassy
python3 MALLORCA_PATTERN_ENGINE_ADAPTER.py --stream all
```

### Status
- ✅ Adapter code ready (uses mock data currently)
- ⏳ Real data sources need implementation (TODOs marked in code)
- ⏳ Waiting for Captain to test

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Captain's TODO)

### PRIORITY 1 (This Week)
1. **Verify Stage 1 timeline** - Dec 3 or Jan 2026? (Check EU portal)
2. **Collect Mallorca intel** - Contact friend for property specs, cooperative details, UIB connection
3. **Test Pattern Engine adapter** (optional) - Run with mock data to verify

### PRIORITY 2 (Upon Stage 1 Results)
4. **IF POSITIVE**: Launch consortium outreach (templates ready in `xyl_phos_cure/CONSORTIUM_STRATEGY.md`)
5. **IF POSITIVE**: Schedule videoconferences (UIB-INAGEA, CIHEAM-Bari)
6. **IF POSITIVE**: Draft Stage 2 proposal (deadline Feb 18, 2026)

### PRIORITY 3 (Ongoing)
7. Implement real data sources for Pattern Engine (start with Stage 1 monitoring)
8. Establish physical presence in Mallorca (upon Stage 1 positive)
9. Position for Agriculture of Data partnership (2026-2027)

## 📊 PROJECT CONTEXT (Quick Summary)

### The Opportunity
- **XYL-PHOS-CURE**: First systemic curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa
- **Innovation**: Phosphinic acid derivatives (based on Fosfomycin antibiotic precedent)
- **Budget**: €6M (Horizon Europe, 42 months)
- **Market**: €5.5B annual threat, 300,000 jobs at risk
- **Stage**: Stage 1 submitted Sept 4, 2025; awaiting results

### The Convergence
- **Mallorca Friend**: Hectares of infected olive/almond trees + office space
- **UIB Partnership**: Daughter connected to UIB Xylella research group
- **Cooperative Network**: Multi-Actor Approach validation
- **Ground Zero**: Mallorca = active Xylella research hub in EU

### The Strategy
- **Stage 2 Prep**: Build consortium (UIB-INAGEA, CIHEAM-Bari, Industrial SME)
- **Living Lab**: Friend's property = field trial site
- **Multi-Actor**: Cooperative network = farmer involvement
- **Commercialization**: License to agrochemicals OR direct-to-market via cooperatives
- **Parallel Funding**: Agriculture of Data, EIC Accelerator, Innovation Fund

## 🎯 FOR FUTURE CLAUDE SESSIONS

**Quick Context Load:**
1. Read this file (START_HERE.md)
2. Read `operations/ACTION_ITEMS.md` for current priorities
3. Read `xyl_phos_cure/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for project details
4. Check `xyl_phos_cure/STAGE1_STATUS.md` for latest status

**Common Tasks:**
- Update ACTION_ITEMS.md as tasks complete
- Monitor Stage 1 results (Dec-Jan window)
- Prepare consortium outreach materials (if Stage 1 positive)
- Collect Mallorca property intelligence (ongoing)
- Implement real data sources for Pattern Engine (as needed)

**Don't Get Lost In:**
- Multiple Pattern Engine doc files (use PATTERN_ENGINE_INTEGRATION_README.md as guide)
- Archive exploration (reference when needed, don't re-read)
- Documentation rabbit holes (focus on ACTION_ITEMS.md)

## 📊 METRICS

**Documentation Size**: 468 KB (25 files)  
**Core Files**: 3 (this file, PROJECT_OVERVIEW, ACTION_ITEMS)  
**Executable Code**: 1 (MALLORCA_PATTERN_ENGINE_ADAPTER.py)  
**Expected Value**: €12-25M (temporal advantage + IP + parallel funding)  
**Stage 2 Probability**: 70-85% (with Mallorca integration)
