## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Industrial Partner Search (Priority: HIGH)
**Target**: Identify 2-3 candidates by December 2025  
**Approach**: Screen Syngenta, BASF, Corteva for phosphonate formulation expertise  
**Goal**: Secure industrial partner commitment letter for Stage 2 proposal

### 2. Mallorca Property Intelligence (Priority: HIGH)
**Needed**:
- Exact specifications (hectares, GPS coordinates)
- Xylella infection status (% trees affected, subspecies)
- Cooperative network size (# farms, total hectares, crops)
- Daughter's UIB connection (research group, supervisor name, current projects)

**Purpose**: Stage 2 Multi-Actor Approach section + Living Lab specifications

### 3. UIB Contact Initiation (Priority: HIGH)
**Action**: Reach out via daughter's connection  
**Request**:
- Lab visit + capability briefing
- Stage 2 partnership discussion
- Access to Xylella research infrastructure details

**Timeline**: December 2025 (before Stage 1 results)

### 4. Patent Strategy Preparation (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Plan**:
- Provisional filing target: Year 2 (2027)
- Budget allocation: €50-100K for patent attorney
- Coverage: 25-40 compounds (broad portfolio)

**Rationale**: First-mover IP advantage (2-3 year window before competitors notice)

### 5. Stage 1 Results Monitoring (Priority: ONGOING)
**Action**: Check EU Funding & Tenders Portal weekly  
**Expected**: January 2026 (could be December 2025)  
**Window**: 45 days from notification to Stage 2 submission  
**Prep**: Start consortium framework NOW (don't wait)

## Strategic Verdict

### From Evaluator-Grade Assessment:

> "XYL-PHOS-CURE is HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD with EXCEPTIONAL positioning.
> 
> All 4 Pattern Engine signals GREEN.
> 
> This is the BEST SHOT at a Xylella cure in the EU research pipeline.
> 
> Not guaranteed (15.9% end-to-end) — but WORTH THE BET.
> 
> Even 'failure' scenarios create value (IP, platform, partnerships).
> 
> Proceed with Stage 2 consortium building NOW."

### Why This Works Even at 15.9% Probability:

1. **De-Risked Investment**: €6M EU funding (not UBOS capital)
2. **Value Creation at TRL 6**: Even without market approval, IP portfolio + EIC Accelerator eligibility (€15M) = asset value
3. **Platform Value**: Mallorca Embassy operational presence = future projects
4. **Partnership Network**: UIB, CIHEAM connections = long-term value beyond single project
5. **First-Mover Advantage**: 2-3 year IP window before competitors catch up

### Risk-Adjusted Decision Framework:

- **Best Case** (15.9% probability): €55M revenue over 10 years
- **TRL 6 Case** (52.5% probability): IP portfolio + EIC pathway + licensing interest
- **Failure Case** (remaining probability): Learning, platform, partnership network

**Expected value remains POSITIVE across all scenarios.**

## Next Session Pickup

**For Future Claude/AI Sessions:**

1. **Read First**: `START_HERE.md` (5-minute orientation)
2. **Check Status**: `signals/REAL_PATTERN_ENGINE_PULSE.json` (current decision dashboard)
3. **Review Actions**: `operations/ACTION_ITEMS.md` (prioritized tasks)
4. **Execute**: Start with ACTION 1 (Industrial partner search) or ACTION 2 (Mallorca intel)

**Decision Point**: If Stage 1 results arrive (Jan 2026):
- If **PASS**: Execute consortium building (45-day sprint to Stage 2)
- If **FAIL**: Pivot to alternative funding (Agriculture of Data, regional grants)
