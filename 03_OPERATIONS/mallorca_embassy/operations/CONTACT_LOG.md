## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Strategic Communication Points

**Key Messages for All Partners**:
1. **Only systemic curative chemistry** in EU Xylella pipeline (unique opportunity)
2. **Physical presence in Mallorca** (operational legitimacy, not theoretical research)
3. **Multi-Actor Approach from day one** (genuine farmer involvement)
4. **Perfect timing**: BeXyl ending 2026 = next generation positioning
5. **Clear commercialization pathway**: IP strategy, EIC Accelerator follow-on, licensing to majors

**Partner-Specific Value Propositions**:
- **UIB-INAGEA**: Access to novel chemistry, co-authorship, PhD student projects, €1.5M budget
- **CIHEAM-Bari**: Italian field validation in Apulia (highest visibility), training program integration
- **Industrial**: First-mover advantage on novel chemical class, IP licensing opportunity
- **Cooperative**: Direct benefit (curative treatment for members' trees), policy influence
