- **Target**: 3-5 candidates identified by Dec 1
- **Decision**: Final selection upon Stage 1 results (evaluate based on response timing)

### ⏸️ WAITING: UIB-INAGEA Formal Partnership
- **Status**: Contact pathway being established (ACTION 5)
- **Dependency**: Mallorca daughter introduction
- **Timeline**: Formal outreach within 24-48 hours of Stage 1 positive results

---

## RISK TRACKING

### Risk 1: Insufficient Consortium Building Timeline
- **Status**: MITIGATED
- **Mitigation**: Pre-positioning materials (ACTION 3, 5, 6)
- **Contingency**: Backup partners identified (University of Valencia, CNR Apulia)

### Risk 2: Industrial Partner Availability
- **Status**: ACTIVE MONITORING
- **Mitigation**: Multiple candidates pipeline (ACTION 4)
- **Contingency**: Expand search to EU-wide (not just ideal regions)

### Risk 3: Mallorca Property Access Issues
- **Status**: LOW RISK
- **Mitigation**: Friend commitment confirmed, daughter UIB connection validates
- **Contingency**: Alternative Mallorca cooperative sites (if primary unavailable)

### Risk 4: Stage 1 Negative Results
- **Status**: CONTINGENCY PLANNED
- **Mitigation**: Alternative pathways documented (BeXyl follow-on, Agriculture of Data)
- **Decision Point**: Pivot to 2026-2027 call preparation vs. resubmission analysis
