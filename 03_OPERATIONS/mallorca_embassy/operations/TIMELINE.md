## KEY DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Stage 1 Results Date** → Determines consortium building timeline
2. **Mallorca Property Intelligence** → Enables Living Lab proposal section
3. **UIB-INAGEA Partnership** → Essential for in-vitro/greenhouse work packages
4. **Industrial Partner** → Required for commercialization credibility
5. **CIHEAM-Bari Commitment** → Validates field trial capability

### Risk Factors:
- **Timeline Compression**: <40 days from results to submission = extremely tight
- **Partner Availability**: Key personnel on holiday (Christmas/New Year)
- **Industrial Partner Search**: May require >2 weeks to secure commitment
- **Mallorca Visit Logistics**: Weather, availability could delay site assessment

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Pre-Positioning**: All materials prepared in November-December (reduces timeline by 7-10 days)
- **Parallel Processes**: Contact all partners simultaneously (not sequential)
- **Backup Partners**: Secondary options identified for each role
- **Template Sections**: Proposal framework pre-drafted (reduces writing time 50%)

---

## TIMELINE ASSUMPTIONS

**Working Days**:
- Exclude: December 25-26 (Christmas), January 1 (New Year)
- Reduced capacity: December 27-31 (holiday period)
- Full capacity: All other days

**Partner Response Times**:
- Initial interest: 24-48 hours
- Videoconference scheduling: 3-5 days
- LOI preparation: 7-10 days (normal) / 2-3 days (expedited)
- Final sign-off: 2-3 days

**Proposal Writing**:
- Excellence section: 7-10 days (pre-drafted: 3-5 days)
- Impact section: 5-7 days (pre-drafted: 2-3 days)
- Implementation section: 10-14 days (consortium dependent)
- Partner review cycles: 5-7 days (normal) / 2-3 days (compressed)
- Final formatting: 2-3 days

**TOTAL REQUIRED TIME**:
- **Optimal** (76 days): 60 days execution + 16 days buffer = LOW RISK
- **Compressed** (34 days): 30 days execution + 4 days buffer = MODERATE RISK
- **Critical** (<30 days): Feasible but HIGH RISK (requires perfect execution)

---

## NEXT REVIEW TRIGGERS

**Timeline Update Required Upon**:
1. ✅ Stage 1 results date verification (ACTION 1 complete)
2. ⏳ Stage 1 results announcement (positive or negative)
3. ⏳ First partner LOI received (validates response time assumptions)
4. ⏳ Industrial partner confirmed (de-risks critical dependency)
5. ⏳ Mallorca site visit completed (de-risks Living Lab section)

**Last Updated**: November 5, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Awaiting Stage 1 results date verification  
**Next Update**: Upon ACTION 1 completion (timeline verification)
