# XYL-PHOS-CURE Multi-Actor Approach Framework

> **Horizon Europe Requirement**: Active and continuous involvement of diverse actors throughout project lifecycle  
> **XYL-PHOS-CURE Status**: Genuine integration (not compliance checkbox)  
> **Strategic Advantage**: Mallorca Embassy provides physical presence for authentic stakeholder engagement

---

## Multi-Actor Approach Definition

### Horizon Europe Requirements

The Multi-Actor Approach (MAA) mandates:
1. **Diversity of actors**: Research, industry, end-users, advisors
2. **Co-design**: Stakeholders shape research questions and methods
3. **Active participation**: Continuous involvement, not just consultation
4. **Knowledge exchange**: Bidirectional learning throughout project

### XYL-PHOS-CURE Implementation

**Not tokenistic**: Mallorca cooperative network isn't added for compliance—it's embedded in project DNA through physical embassy presence on affected agricultural land.

  - Topics: Application timing (harvest cycles), equipment compatibility (existing spray systems), economic thresholds (cost per hectare)
  - Output: Workshop minutes as MAA evidence for proposal

- [ ] **Industrial Partner Input** on synthesis targets
  - Objective: Formulation chemist advises on which phosphinic acid properties enable stable products
  - Topics: Solubility, stability, compatibility with commercial adjuvants
  - Output: Synthesis strategy informed by downstream formulation needs (WP2-WP6 linkage)

**Documentation for Stage 2**:
- Co-design workshop minutes (dated before submission)
- Participant list (farmers, cooperative leadership, UBOS, UIB if available)
- Key insights captured (farmer priorities, practical constraints identified)

---

### Phase 2: Research & Development (WP2-4 - Year 1-2)

**WP2 (Synthesis) - UBOS Lead**:
- **Industrial Partner Involvement**: Monthly videoconferences to review compound properties
  - Are synthesized compounds suitable for formulation?
  - Early red flags on scalability or stability?
- **Farmer Input**: None direct (too technical), but synthesis targets informed by co-design workshop priorities

**WP3 (In-Vitro Screening) - UIB-INAGEA Lead**:
- **Cooperative Engagement**: Quarterly updates to cooperative leadership
  - Which compounds show promise?
  - Timeline for field trials?
- **Industrial Partner**: Review screening criteria
  - Do in-vitro results predict field efficacy?
  - What additional tests would inform formulation?

**WP4 (Greenhouse Validation) - UIB-INAGEA Lead**:
- **Farmer Visits**: Invite cooperative members to UIB greenhouse for demonstration
  - See plants treated with phosphinic acids
  - Understand systemic uptake concept (not just spray and forget)
- **Industrial Partner**: Observe application methods in greenhouse
  - Test different formulation prototypes
  - Gather feedback on ease of use

**Governance Mechanism**: **Advisory Board**
- **Composition**: 1 cooperative representative, 1 industrial partner, 1 CIHEAM extension specialist
- **Frequency**: Quarterly meetings (remote)
- **Authority**: Strategic guidance, no project management control
- **Documentation**: Meeting minutes, recommendations tracked in project reports

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (WP5 - Year 3-4)

**Living Lab Model** (Core MAA Implementation):

**Mallorca Site (Anchor)**:
- **Property Owner (Friend)**: Primary trial host
  - Provides trial plots (infected olive/almond trees)
  - Applies treatments with UBOS/UIB supervision
  - Observes and documents plant health changes
  - Hosts demonstration days for other farmers

- **Cooperative Members**: Distributed trials
  - 5-10 additional member farms host smaller trial plots
  - Diversity of microclimates, tree ages, infection severities
  - Farmer-to-farmer data sharing via cooperative meetings

**Apulia Site (CIHEAM-Bari)**:
- **Italian Farmer Network**: CIHEAM connects to local olive growers
  - Worst-case validation (pauca strain, severe infections)
  - Cultural exchange (Mallorca-Apulia farmer visits if budget allows)

**Farmer as Active Researchers**:
- **Not passive test sites**: Farmers co-design application protocols
  - When to apply? (before/after flowering, seasonal considerations)
  - How to apply? (backpack sprayer, tractor-mounted, drip injection)
  - What to observe? (symptoms, timing of improvement, tree survival)

- **Data Collection**: Simple protocols farmers can execute
  - Photo documentation (smartphone apps)
  - Visual symptom scoring (leaf scorch scale, wilting severity)
  - Tree survival tracking (monthly updates)

**Demonstration Days**: Public engagement
- **Timing**: Mid-trial (Year 3) and end-trial (Year 4)
- **Audience**: Regional farmers, cooperative networks, extension services, policymakers
- **Format**: Field tours, results presentation, Q&A, peer-to-peer discussion
- **Output**: 50-100 farmers exposed to treatment, word-of-mouth dissemination begins

---

### Phase 4: Dissemination & Exploitation (WP6 - Year 4-5)

**Farmers as Advocates**:
- **Testimonial Videos**: Cooperative members share experiences
  - "Before phosphinic acid treatment, I was going to cut down my grove. Now my trees are recovering."
- **Farmer-Written Guides**: Co-author practical application manuals
  - Language: Spanish, Italian (local languages, not just English academic papers)
  - Format: Illustrated, step-by-step, economically framed (€ per hectare, ROI calculations)

**Industry as Commercializer**:
- **Business Plan Development**: Industrial partner leads
  - Market size analysis (how many farms need this?)
  - Pricing strategy (what can farmers afford?)
  - Distribution channels (through cooperatives? Agrochemical retailers?)
- **Regulatory Dossier**: Begin EU plant protection product registration
  - Field trial data from WP5 forms core of dossier
  - Farmer testimonials support "real-world efficacy" claims

**Extension Services as Multipliers**:
- **CIHEAM Training Program**: Integrate XYL-PHOS-CURE into curriculum
  - Next generation of agronomists learn about novel curative approach
  - Regional extension offices receive training materials
- **Policy Briefs**: Translate findings for plant health authorities
  - Recommendations for updating phytosanitary strategies (add "curative treatment" to IPM toolkit)

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

### How Evaluators Assess MAA (Stage 2)

**Scoring Considerations** (from evaluator guidance):
1. **Diversity**: Multiple actor types genuinely involved?
2. **Early Involvement**: Co-design or just late-stage consultation?
3. **Active Participation**: Ongoing engagement or one-off meeting?
4. **Influence on Research**: Does stakeholder input actually shape the project?
5. **Credibility**: Are actors appropriate and committed?

### XYL-PHOS-CURE Strengths:

✅ **Diversity**: Research (UIB, CIHEAM) + Industry (formulation SME) + End-Users (cooperative) + Extension (CIHEAM training)

✅ **Early Involvement**: Co-design workshop BEFORE Stage 2 submission (dated evidence)

✅ **Active Participation**: Advisory Board (quarterly), demonstration days, continuous farmer engagement in WP5

✅ **Influence on Research**: 
- Farmer input → application protocol design
- Industrial input → synthesis strategy
- Extension input → dissemination format

✅ **Credibility**:
- Cooperative = real stakeholder (not recruited for compliance)
- Physical presence on property = operational legitimacy
- UIB/CIHEAM = research quality + farmer networks
- Industrial partner = commercial pathway

**Anticipated Score**: 4.5-5 / 5 on MAA criterion (with Mallorca integration)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Tokenistic Participation
**Mitigation**: Physical Mallorca Embassy presence = genuine embedment, not symbolic

### Risk: Farmer Fatigue (consultation burnout)
**Mitigation**: Compensate farmer time (budget allocation), demonstrate tangible benefit (treatments for their trees)

### Risk: Power Imbalance (academics dominate, farmers marginalized)
**Mitigation**: Advisory Board with equal voice, co-design workshops facilitated by neutral party, farmer testimonials weighted in decision-making

### Risk: Conflicting Priorities (research rigor vs. practical needs)
**Mitigation**: Hybrid protocols (scientifically valid BUT farmer-executable), industrial partner mediates between research and market

---

## Success Metrics for MAA

### Quantitative:
- Number of farmers engaged: Target 50+ (10 trial hosts + 40 demonstration day attendees)
- Number of co-design workshops: Target 3 (pre-project, mid-project, end-project)
- Advisory Board meetings: Target 12 (quarterly over 3 years)
- Farmer-authored outputs: Target 2 (practical guide, testimonial video)

### Qualitative:
- Farmer quotes in project reports: "This project actually listened to us"
- Industrial partner satisfaction: "Research outputs were commercially relevant"
- Extension service adoption: CIHEAM integrates findings into training curriculum
- Policy impact: Regional plant health authorities update IPM guidelines to include curative treatments

---

## Conclusion

**XYL-PHOS-CURE MAA is genuine because**:
1. Mallorca Embassy = physical presence (not remote consultation)
2. Cooperative = real stakeholder with skin in game (their trees are infected)
3. Co-design = before project start (not retrofitted)
4. Living Lab = farmers as active researchers (not passive test sites)
5. Influence = stakeholder input shapes research design (documented examples)

**This isn't compliance theater—it's operational necessity.**

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Conduct co-design workshop (pre-Stage 2 submission)
2. Secure commitment letters (all actors)
3. Document MAA evidence for Stage 2 proposal
4. Establish Advisory Board terms of reference

**Last Updated**: November 5, 2025  
**Status**: Framework complete, implementation upon Stage 1 positive results
