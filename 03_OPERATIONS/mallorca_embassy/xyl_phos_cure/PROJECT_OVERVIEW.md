## Project Overview

XYL-PHOS-CURE aims to develop the first systemic curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa, the plant pathogen threatening €5.5 billion in EU agricultural production. Our novel approach uses phosphinic acid derivatives to create systemic bactericides that can cure infected olive, citrus, and almond trees.

## The Problem

- **Xylella fastidiosa** is Europe's most dangerous plant pathogen
- **€5.5 billion** annual economic threat to EU agriculture  
- **No cure exists** - only containment and vector control
- Affects olive groves, citrus orchards, and almond trees across Mediterranean regions
- Threatens 300,000 agricultural jobs in the EU

## Our Innovation

### Novel Chemistry Approach
- **Phosphinic acid derivatives** designed for systemic plant uptake
- Based on proven antibacterial activity (Fosfomycin precedent)
- Targets gram-negative bacterial metabolism
- Systemic delivery via xylem transport

### Chemistry-to-Field Pathway
1. **In-silico design** → Rational compound selection
2. **Synthesis** → 25-40 novel phosphinic acid derivatives  
3. **In-vitro validation** → Anti-Xylella activity screening
4. **Greenhouse trials** → Systemic uptake and efficacy
5. **Living lab pilots** → Field validation with farmers

## Project Timeline

- **Duration**: 42 months
- **Budget**: €6M (Horizon Europe RIA)
- **Target TRL**: 2-3 → 5-6
- **Stage 1 Results**: January 2026
- **Stage 2 Deadline**: February 18, 2026 (if selected)

## Mallorca Embassy Integration

**Living Lab Field Site**: Mallorca partner property with:
- Hectares of olive and almond trees affected by Xylella
- Direct access to agricultural cooperative network
- Physical office space for operational base
- Connection to UIB-INAGEA research labs

**Multi-Actor Approach**: 
- **Farmers**: Cooperative network through Mallorca partner
- **Research**: UIB-INAGEA (Spain), CIHEAM-Bari (Italy)
- **Industry**: Agrochemical formulation partner (TBD)
- **UBOS**: AI platform integration, project coordination

**Strategic Value**: Physical presence in Xylella ground zero provides operational legitimacy and direct field trial capability from project start.

## Next Steps (Stage 2 Preparation)

### Consortium Building
**Target partners** (based on Janus-Perplexity reconnaissance):
- **Spain**: UIB-INAGEA (molecular biology, plant biotech labs)
- **Spain**: UIB-IFISC (ML/AI for Xylella remote sensing)  
- **Spain**: CSIC QuantaLab (hyperspectral detection)
- **Italy**: CIHEAM-Bari (plant pathology, Apulia field trials)
- **Industry**: EU agrochemical SME with phosphonate formulation experience

### Multi-Actor Approach
- **Research institutions**: UIB, CIHEAM-Bari for scientific validation
- **Farmer cooperatives**: Mallorca network for field trial sites and adoption
- **Industry**: Formulation partner for commercialization pathway
- **UBOS**: Coordinator + AI platform provider

### Stage 2 Proposal Requirements
- **Length**: Comprehensive 45-50 page submission
- **Deadline**: February 18, 2026 (if Stage 1 passes)
- **Key sections**: Excellence, Impact, Implementation (consortium, work packages, budget)
- **Regulatory Strategy**: EU plant protection product registration pathway

## Contact & Team

**SME Coordinator**: UBOS (Romania)  
**Scientific Lead**: PhD expertise in phosphinic acid chemistry  
**Mallorca Operations**: Partner property + UIB partnership + cooperative network  
**Target Partners**: Plant pathology labs, agricultural cooperatives, formulation companies

## Impact Vision

A successful XYL-PHOS-CURE project will deliver:
- First curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa
- Systemic solution complementing containment strategies  
- Protection of European agricultural heritage (ancient olive groves)
- New chemical class for plant health therapeutics
- Economic benefit of billions in prevented losses
- 300,000 jobs protected across Mediterranean agriculture

## Strategic Positioning

**Unique Differentiators**:
1. **Only systemic curative chemistry** in EU research pipeline (vs. BeXyl/XF-ACTORS detection focus)
2. **PhD-level phosphinic acid expertise** (proven track record in this specific chemical class)
3. **Physical presence in Xylella ground zero** (Mallorca operational base on affected property)
4. **Multi-Actor Approach from day one** (embedded farmer cooperative network)
5. **Perfect timing** (BeXyl ending 2026 = "next generation" positioning)

**Market Gap**: 
- Current EU strategy: Containment, detection, prevention only
- XYL-PHOS-CURE: **Curative intervention** for already-infected trees
- Commercial pathway: Licensing to major agrochemical companies (Syngenta, BASF, Corteva)

*This project represents a paradigm shift from defensive containment to curative intervention in the fight against Xylella fastidiosa.*
