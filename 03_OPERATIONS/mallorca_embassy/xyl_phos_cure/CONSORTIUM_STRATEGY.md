## Multi-Actor Approach Implementation

### Definition (Horizon Europe)

The Multi-Actor Approach (MAA) requires **active and continuous involvement** of diverse actors throughout the project lifecycle: co-design, execution, dissemination.

### XYL-PHOS-CURE MAA Strategy

**Phase 1: Co-Design (Proposal Stage)**
- **Farmers**: Mallorca cooperative co-designs field trial protocols (WP5)
  - Application timing (alignment with agricultural calendar)
  - Equipment compatibility (existing spray systems)
  - Economic thresholds (cost-benefit analysis)

- **Industry**: Formulation partner advises on synthesis targets (WP2)
  - Molecular properties for stable formulations
  - Commercial viability criteria

**Phase 2: Research & Development (WP2-4)**
- **Advisory Board**: Quarterly meetings with cooperative, industry, CIHEAM-Bari representatives
  - Strategic guidance on research direction
  - Alignment check with practical needs

- **Industry Integration**: Formulation partner reviews WP2 outputs
  - Feedback loop from chemistry to formulation requirements

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (WP5)**
- **Living Lab Model**: Farmers as active research partners
  - Apply treatments on their own properties
  - Collect observational data (plant health, ease of use)
  - Participate in data interpretation workshops

- **Demonstration Days**: Cooperative hosts field days for regional farmers
  - Show treatments in action
  - Peer-to-peer knowledge transfer

**Phase 4: Dissemination & Exploitation (WP6)**
- **Farmers as Advocates**: Co-author practical guides
- **Industry as Commercializer**: Lead business plan development
- **Extension Services**: Translate findings for advisory services
- **Policy Partner**: Create policy briefs for plant health authorities

### Documentation for Stage 2

**Evidence of MAA**:
- Letters of commitment from Mallorca cooperative (with specific roles defined)
- Co-design workshop minutes (conduct workshop before Stage 2 submission)
- Advisory Board terms of reference (in Consortium Agreement)
- Dedicated MAA section in proposal (how each actor contributes at each stage)

5. **Template Preparation**: Have Stage 2 template sections drafted (can fill in partner details quickly)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Partner Unavailability
- **Mitigation**: Maintain backup list for each partner category
- **UIB-INAGEA backup**: University of Valencia (plant pathology), University of Córdoba
- **CIHEAM-Bari backup**: CNR institutes in Apulia, University of Salento
- **Industrial backup**: Multiple candidates in pipeline

### Risk 2: Insufficient Timeline
- **Mitigation**: Pre-preparation before Stage 1 results
  - Partner intelligence gathered (this document)
  - Contact points identified
  - Introduction pathways established (Mallorca partner's daughter)
  - Stage 2 template partially drafted

### Risk 3: Budget Disagreements
- **Mitigation**: Clear budget allocation principles established in advance
  - Proportional to effort (person-months)
  - Transparent cost justification
  - Early discussion of expectations (Week 1-2)

### Risk 4: IP Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Clear IP strategy documented
  - UBOS owns phosphinic acid compound patents (core IP)
  - Partner background IP clearly defined
  - Licensing terms pre-negotiated in Consortium Agreement
  - No joint ownership (clear delineation)

---

## Success Metrics

### Stage 2 Proposal Quality
- **Excellence**: PhD expertise + UIB labs + CIHEAM field sites = world-class capability
- **Impact**: €5.5B threat + 300,000 jobs + Multi-Actor Approach = high societal value
- **Implementation**: Lean consortium + proven partners + Mallorca legitimacy = feasible plan

### Evaluation Advantages
1. **Multi-Actor Approach**: Mallorca cooperative involvement from day one (genuine, not token)
2. **Geographic Coverage**: Spain (Mallorca) + Italy (Apulia) = two major Xylella zones
3. **Operational Legitimacy**: Physical presence on affected property = not theoretical research
4. **Continuity**: Links to BeXyl (€7M ending 2026) = builds on EU investment
5. **Commercial Viability**: Industrial partner + IP strategy = clear path to market

**Target Score**: 14+ / 15 points (threshold ~12) with Mallorca integration enhancement

---

## Next Steps

1. **VERIFY** Stage 1 results date (Dec 3 or Jan 2026)
2. **COLLECT** Mallorca property/cooperative intelligence (see `../property_intelligence/`)
3. **PREPARE** partner outreach templates (invitation letters, partner profiles)
4. **IDENTIFY** industrial partner candidates (search in December)
5. **DRAFT** Stage 2 template sections (can fill in partner details upon confirmation)
