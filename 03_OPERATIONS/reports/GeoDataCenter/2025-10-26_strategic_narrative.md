## III. Strategic Positioning

### A. Core Value Proposition

**Three Pillars:**

1. **Digital Sovereignty**
   - Reduces EU dependence on non-EU cloud providers
   - Ensures data residency compliance (GDPR, NIS2)
   - Strengthens European technological autonomy

2. **Climate Leadership**
   - Net-zero operational targets by 2030
   - Renewable energy integration (75%+ target)
   - Circular economy principles in hardware lifecycle

3. **Economic Resilience**
   - Creates high-skilled employment across regions
   - Supports SME access to advanced computing
   - Builds competitive advantage in AI/data analytics

### B. Geographic Distribution Strategy

**Rationale for EU Funding Bodies:**
- Reduces regional digital divides
- Supports cohesion policy objectives
- Enables disaster recovery and redundancy
- Optimizes latency for European users

**Proposed Hub Locations:**
- Northern Europe (renewable energy access)
- Central Europe (geographic center, connectivity)
- Southern Europe (Mediterranean connectivity)
- Eastern Europe (growth markets, cost efficiency)

## V. Funding Strategy

### A. Multi-Source Approach

**Tier 1: Direct EU Grants**
- Digital Europe Programme: €150-250M (infrastructure)
- Horizon Europe: €50-100M (R&D, green tech)
- CEF 2.0: €100-150M (connectivity)

**Tier 2: Member State Co-Funding**
- Recovery and Resilience Facility allocations
- National digital infrastructure budgets
- Regional development funds

**Tier 3: Blended Finance**
- European Investment Bank (EIB) loans
- Green bonds for sustainability-linked financing
- Public-private partnerships

### B. Competitive Advantages for Funding

✓ **Addresses EU strategic autonomy gap**
