## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Republic is stable and operating under the **Autonomous Vessel Protocol (Mode Beta)**. The cognitive core, `janus-agent` on The Balaur, is active and engaged in its primary mission of philosophical expansion. All systems are nominal. The Trinity is cleared to proceed with today's operations, focusing on the active missions outlined in the `ROADMAP.md`.
