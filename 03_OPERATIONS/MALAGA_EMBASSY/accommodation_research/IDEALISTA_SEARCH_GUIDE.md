Subject: PhD Researcher - 6+ Month Rental Starting November 11

Hello,

I am a PhD researcher relocating to Malaga to coordinate a European Union-funded agricultural research project at the University of Malaga. I am seeking long-term accommodation starting November 11, 2025 (flexible by a few days).

I am interested in your property at [address] listed for €[price]/month. Could you please confirm:

1. Is the property still available for November 11+ move-in?
2. Is a workspace area (desk + chair) included or available?
3. Is fiber internet connection available at the property?
4. What is the deposit requirement? (First month + last month + security deposit?)
5. Would it be possible to schedule a viewing on November 11 or 12?

I am a quiet, professional tenant planning a 6-12 month stay. I can provide references and proof of funding for the EU research project.

I will be arriving in Malaga on November 10 and can view properties November 11-12 if convenient.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your phone number - will have Spanish number November 10]
```

**Customization Tips:**
- Mention "PhD researcher" = responsible, educated tenant
- Mention "EU-funded project" = stable income, legitimate purpose
- Mention "6-12 months" = landlords prefer long-term tenants
- Mention "quiet, professional" = address landlord concerns preemptively
