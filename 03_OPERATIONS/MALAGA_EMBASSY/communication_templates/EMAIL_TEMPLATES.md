```
Dear Professor [Department Head Name / Research Group Coordinator],

I am writing to introduce a significant research partnership opportunity for the University of Malaga's IHSM "La Mayora" Microbiology and Pathology of Plants research group (AGR169).

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
We have successfully submitted Stage 1 of the XYL-PHOS-CURE project to Horizon Europe (Call: HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-01-two-stage), focusing on novel biocontrol strategies for Xylella fastidiosa infections threatening European agriculture. Stage 1 results will be announced December 3, 2025, and we are now forming our Stage 2 consortium for submission January 15, 2026.

WHY UNIVERSITY OF MALAGA:
Your research group's expertise makes UMA the ideal academic lead partner for this €6 million, 48-month Research and Innovation Action:
- Bacterial and fungal plant disease expertise (Xylella = bacterial pathogen)
- Biocontrol strategies compatible with ecological agriculture
- Metagenomics and molecular diagnostic capabilities
- Proven EU project management and administration capacity

CONSORTIUM ROLE FOR UMA:
- Lead Academic Partner for Work Packages 3 & 4 (Laboratory and Greenhouse Validation)
- Provision of biosafety containment facilities for Xylella testing
- Scientific publication and dissemination leadership
- Significant budget allocation (€800K-€1.2M of €6M total)

NEXT STEPS:
I will be establishing our project coordination office in Malaga during the week of November 11-15 to facilitate close collaboration with our Spanish academic partner. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting to discuss partnership details and potential roles for UMA in this consortium?

The project addresses a critical gap in European plant health protection and offers UMA leadership positioning in Mediterranean agricultural research.

I look forward to your response and the opportunity to discuss this collaboration.

- Access to Italian field trial sites in Apulia outbreak region

BUILDING ON XF-ACTORS FOUNDATION:
XF-ACTORS established the scientific understanding and research networks that make projects like XYL-PHOS-CURE possible. We aim to build upon your consortium's remarkable achievements by:
- Developing novel treatment strategies (complementing biocontrol approaches)
- Leveraging the diagnostic infrastructure XF-ACTORS established
- Engaging the Mediterranean research network you cultivated
- Contributing to the long-term European Xylella management strategy

CONSORTIUM ROLE FOR CNR-IPSP:
- Scientific Excellence Partner (Work Packages 3 & 5)
- Xylella-specific validation and diagnostic expertise
- Italian field trial coordination (Apulia region)
- Significant budget allocation (€800K-€1M of €6M total)

NEXT STEPS:
Would you be open to a discussion about potential partnership and CNR-IPSP's role in providing scientific validation for this project? I will be establishing a coordination base in Malaga, Spain (in proximity to one of our Spanish academic partners) and would be delighted to arrange a meeting or video call at your convenience in December or early January.

This project represents an opportunity to continue building on XF-ACTORS' remarkable legacy and contribute to European agricultural resilience.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.

**Subject:** EU Research Partnership - Protecting Iberian Agriculture from Xylella fastidiosa

```
Dear Mr. Gomez,

I am writing to introduce a unique European Union-funded research opportunity that could position AlVelAl as an innovation leader in protecting Iberian agriculture from the Xylella fastidiosa threat.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
XYL-PHOS-CURE is a €6 million Horizon Europe project developing novel biocontrol strategies for Xylella infections threatening almond and olive production across the Mediterranean. We are forming an international consortium and seek end-user partners representing farming communities.

WHY ALVELAL:
Your organization's cross-border Iberian model and regenerative agriculture leadership make AlVelAl the ideal end-user partner:
- Largest organic almond production region globally
- Active Portugal-Spain farmer exchange network (TransFarmers project)
- Almond focus (primary Xylella threat crop in Iberian Peninsula)
- Commitment to sustainable, regenerative agricultural practices

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
- Host "Living Lab" field trials in almond orchards (2-3 year timeline)
- Represent farmer interests in project design and validation
- Lead farmer-to-farmer dissemination across Iberian Peninsula
- Budget allocation for coordination and farmer participation (€300K-500K)
- Early access to novel Xylella treatment technologies

STRATEGIC VALUE:
Xylella fastidiosa represents a €5.5 billion annual threat to European agriculture, with 300,000 jobs at risk. AlVelAl partnership positions your farmers as innovation leaders in agricultural resilience.

NEXT STEPS:
I will be traveling to Portugal/Alentejo region December 10-16 from our Malaga coordination base (4-hour drive). Would it be possible to schedule a meeting to discuss this partnership opportunity?

This is an opportunity for AlVelAl to demonstrate regenerative agriculture leadership at the European level.
