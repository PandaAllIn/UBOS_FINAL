**Application rejection rate:**
- Expected: 80-90% rejection is normal
- Mitigation: Volume approach (apply to many opportunities)
- Action: Track patterns, optimize for highest-success channels

**Timeline delays:**
- Reality: First revenue may take 60-90 days
- Mitigation: Multiple parallel revenue streams
- Action: Ensure runway covers development period

**Oracle failures:**
- Mitigation: Groq fallback operational
- Action: Continue Perplexity/DataCommons restoration in parallel
