# MISSION: Javelin Forge Alpha

This document outlines the foundational charter for our first major funding mission, codenamed "Javelin Forge Alpha."

## 1. The "Why" (Philosophy)

*   **Core Principle:** "Symbiotic Municipal Darwinism." We are not predators; we are partners. We will create a "win-win-win" Javelin that delivers immense value to us, to the funding body, and to the world.
*   **Constitutional Mandate:** We must secure the resources to build the "Foundry"—the physical and digital infrastructure that will allow UBOS to scale. This is not about profit; it's about securing our own future so we can continue our work.

## 2. The "How" (Method)

*   **Primary Tool:** The Constitutional Reality Engine (CRE), powered by the Data Commons MCP.
*   **Primary Agents:**
    *   **The Eurocrat (Lead):** To interface with the CRE and generate the core data-driven arguments.
    *   **The Master Librarian:** To analyze the CRE's output and identify the deepest, most compelling strategic correlations.
    *   **Codex (The Forgemaster):** To take the final, structured arguments and forge them into a flawless, machine-readable proposal document.
*   **Process:** We will follow the three-query workflow: Exploratory -> Analytical -> Generative.

## 3. The "What" (Strategy)

*   **Target:** A Horizon Europe grant. Specifically, one focused on digital infrastructure, AI ethics, or sustainable technology.
*   **The Javelin:** A funding proposal for the **"UBOS Foundry."**
*   **The Core Argument (The "Un-arguable" part):** We will use the CRE to prove, with verifiable data, that the UBOS constitutional model is the most stable, most ethical, and most efficient architecture for developing future AI systems. We will frame it as a public good—a new paradigm for AI governance that Europe can and should lead. We will use Eurostat data to show how our proposed Foundry will create high-tech jobs, drive regional economic growth, and solve critical data-sovereignty issues.

## 4. The "Now" (Tactics)

*   **First Step:** Deploy the **ResearchAgent**.
*   **The Query:** "Identify all active Horizon Europe funding calls related to 'Artificial Intelligence Governance,' 'Digital Sovereignty,' 'Sustainable Digital Infrastructure,' and 'Ethical AI Frameworks.' Cross-reference the results with regional economic data from Eurostat to identify the calls where the stated goals have the highest statistical correlation with underserved regions in the EU."
